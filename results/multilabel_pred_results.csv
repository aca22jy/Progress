0,"effectiveness of tobacco control among chinese americans a comparative analysis of policy approaches versus community based programs Abstract Objective To estimate the effectiveness of a tailored multicomponent community-based smoking cessation intervention among Chinese immigrants living in New York City, implemented within the context of state and city-wide tobacco control policy initiatives for the general population. Methods A pre–post-test quasi-experimental design with representative samples from Chinese populations living in two communities in New York City: Flushing, Queens, the intervention community and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, the comparison community. From November 2002 to August 2003 baseline interviews were conducted with 2537 adults aged 18–74. In early 2006, 1384 participants from the original cohort completed the follow-up interview. During the intervention period (October 2003 to September 2005), both communities were exposed to tobacco control public policy changes. However, only Flushing received additional linguistically and culturally-specific community-level tobacco control interventions. Results From 2002 to 2006 overall smoking prevalence among Chinese immigrants declined from 17.7% to 13.6%, a relative 23% decrease. After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, there was an absolute 3.3% decrease in smoking prevalence attributed to policy changes with an additional absolute decline in prevalence of 2.8% in the intervention community relative to the control community. Conclusion City-wide tobacco control policies are effective among high-risk urban communities, such as Chinese immigrants. In addition, community-based tailored tobacco control interventions may increase the reduction in smoking prevalence rates beyond that achieved from public policies.

1,"a trial of church based smoking cessation interventions for rural african americans Background The Alliance of Black Churches Health Project was begun in an effort to address the health problems of the African-American residents of two rural Virginia counties. Smoking cessation was chosen as the principal target behavior in one county. Church coalitions were chosen as the principal organizations through which to implement the interventions. Method A smoking cessation program was designed that combined one-on-one counseling with self-help materials and community-wide activities. To provide these services, up to two smoking cessation counselors were trained from participating churches. To evaluate the impact, population-based cohorts of smokers were assembled in each county using a door-to-door survey. Respondents were recontacted after 18 months. Smoking cessation (1-month continuous abstinence), stages of change, and exposure to the interventions were assessed. Results The overall smoking prevalence at baseline was 25.8%. At follow-up, the smoking cessation rate in the intervention county was 9.6% and in the control county 5.4% (P = 0.18). Among those attending church once a month or more, the respective quit rates were 10.5% and 5.9% (P = 0.20). There was significantly more progress along the stages of change in the intervention than in the control county. There was also higher awareness of and contact with smoking cessation programs in the former compared with the latter. Conclusion Smoking cessation interventions for African Americans can be successfully implemented through a church coalition. The interventions were associated with significant progress along the stages of cessation. Although the quit rate was higher in the intervention community, the difference was not significant.

2,"diversification of smallholding rubber agroforestry system sras thailand The rubber agroforestry system is an alternative agriculture practice for rubber smallholders to enhance the ecological integrity and crop diversity. The data collection for the study of diversification of smallholding rubber agroforestry system (SRAS) included 300 rubber farms of 21 systems in the south, east, and northeast of Thailand. The project results revealed that there are a multitude of 21 rubber farming systems in Thailand. These systems can be classified into three main types: (1) the intercropping rubber-food crop system, growing short-lived plants, for example, pineapple, chili, banana, rice, sweet potato, long bean and corn, for a rubber period, no longer than 36 months; (2) the rubber-fruit crop system, growing multicrop within the rubber area during the rubber productive period. The most common fruit crops that have been grown in Thailand are guava, gnetum, long kong, salacca, mangosteen, durian, and levistona, etc., and (3) the rubber-timber species system, normally yielding higher income to rubber smallholders since the sales of both rubber and wood products are at the same time and this is coupled with the presently high value of wood. The important timber varieties in the rubber area are neem and teak. As for profitability of Smallholding Rubber Agro forestry System (SRAS), it was noted that pineapple, chili, salacca, and gnetum are highly profitable. However, in the rubber-pineapple system which yields the highest income, the cost of investment is the highest too, when compared to the rubber-gnetum system which requires minimal input and low cost of production and management. The main conditions for decision-making in the rubber intercropping system are as follows: (1) farm household labor requirement, (2) knowledge and experience, (3) extension and policy implication, (4) marketing opportunity, (5) consistent capability of local communities, and (6) land topography and sustainability. For SRAS development strategy in the southern Thailand, improvement should be made on pricing and marketing of agroforestry products, appropriate technology for higher productivity, greater farm efficiency and risk reduction at farm level, and more synchronized co-ordination among stakeholder agencies at the regional level.

3,"australia s first national level quantitative environmental justice assessment of industrial air pollution This study presents the first national level quantitative environmental justice assessment of industrial air pollution in Australia. Specifically, our analysis links the spatial distribution of sites and emissions associated with industrial pollution sources derived from the National Pollution Inventory, to Indigenous status and social disadvantage characteristics of communities derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics indicators. Our results reveal a clear national pattern of environmental injustice based on the locations of industrial pollution sources, as well as volume, and toxicity of air pollution released at these locations. Communities with the highest number of polluting sites, emission volume, and toxicity-weighted air emissions indicate significantly greater proportions of Indigenous population and higher levels of socio-economic disadvantage. The quantities and toxicities of industrial air pollution are particularly higher in communities with the lowest levels of educational attainment and occupational status. These findings emphasize the need for more detailed analysis in specific regions and communities where socially disadvantaged groups are disproportionately impacted by industrial air pollution. Our empirical findings also underscore the growing necessity to incorporate environmental justice considerations in environmental planning and policy-making in Australia.

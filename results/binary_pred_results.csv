0,"diabetes self management among low income spanish speaking patients a pilot study Background: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and diabetesrelated morbidity and mortality is higher among low-income Hispanics when compared to that of Whites. However, little is known about how to effectively promote self-management in this population.Purpose: The objectives were first to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of an innovative self-management intervention to improve metabolic control in low-income Spanish-speaking individuals with type 2 diabetes and second to obtain preliminary data of possible intervention effects.Methods: Participants for this pilot study were recruited from a community health center, an elder program, and a community-wide database developed by the community health center, in collaboration with other agencies serving the community, by surveying households in the entire community. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 15) or a control (n = 10) condition. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months postrandomization. The intervention consisted of 10 group sessions that targeted diabetes knowledge, attitudes, and self-management skills through culturally specific and literacysensitive strategies. The intervention used a cognitivebehavioral theoretical framework.Results: Recruitment rates at the community health center, elder program, and community registry were 48%, 69%, and 8%, respectively. Completion rates for baseline, 3-month, and 6-month assessments were 100%, 92%, and 92%, respectively. Each intervention participant attended an average of 7.8 out of 10 sessions, and as a group the participants showed high adherence to intervention activities (93% turned in daily logs, and 80% self-monitored glucose levels at least daily). There was an overall Group × Time interaction (p = .02) indicating group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin over time. The estimated glycosylated hemoglobin decrease at 3 months for the intervention group was −0.8% (95% confidence intervals = −1.1%, −0.5%) compared with the change in the control group (p = .02). At 6 months, the decrease in the intervention group remained significant, −0.85% (95% confidence intervals = −1.2, −0.5), and the decrease was still significantly different from that of the controls (p = .005). There was a trend toward increased physical activity in the intervention group as compared to that of the control group (p = .11) and some evidence (nonsignificant) of an increase in blood glucose self-monitoring in the intervention participants but not the control participants. Adjusting for baseline depressive scores, we oberved a significant difference in depressive symptoms between intervention participants and control participants at the 3-month assessment (p = .02).Conclusions: Low-income Spanish-speaking Hispanics are receptive to participate in diabetes-related research. This study shows that the pilot-tested diabetes self-management program is promising and warrants the conduct of a randomized clinical trial.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.43944433331489563, 0.5016641616821289, 0.38504093885421753, 0.5820706486701965, 0.3709275424480438, 0.4504753649234772, 0.49272340536117554, 0.4682685136795044, 0.4222720265388489]"
1,"breastfeeding among low income women with and without peer support This research examined the effect of peer support on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity (breastfeeding without supplements) in a population of low-income women during the first 3 months postpartum. Participants in the peer counselor group (n = 18) exhibited higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding across time than those without a counselor (n = 18), and more exclusive breastfeeding was associated with long duration overall. Mother s career plans had the greatest effect on duration of breastfeeding. Women who intended to return to work, attend school, or both breastfed 6 to 9 weeks less than participants who intended to stay home. Attendance at a breastfeeding class and knowing someone who had breastfed was significantly correlated with a longer duration of breastfeeding. Nutritionists from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program were the primary source of breastfeeding information. Two main factors discouraged women from breastfeeding: returning to work, school, or both and the perception of a diminished milk supply. Greater emphasis should be placed on prenatal breastfeeding education for low-income women, and their mothers and grandmothers should be included. Peer support is one important component of social support in the area of breastfeeding that community health nurses (CHNs) can utilize. CHNs are in a unique position to assist working mothers, provide support, and develop educational programs to enhance breastfeeding success in this population.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.44437041878700256, 0.4638344943523407, 0.3691754937171936, 0.5318480730056763, 0.379192590713501, 0.516795814037323, 0.5204077363014221, 0.4878182113170624, 0.4338594377040863]"

3,"issues of participation ownership and empowerment in a community development programme tackling smoking in a low income area in scotland SUMMARY Founded on community development principles and practice, the ‘Breathing Space’ initiative aimed to produce a significant shift in community norms towards nontoleration and non-practice of smoking in a low-income area in Edinburgh, Scotland. The effectiveness of Breathing Space was evaluated using a quasi-experimental design, which incorporated a process evaluation in order to provide a description of the development and implementation of the intervention. Drawing on qualitative data from the process evaluation, this paper explores the varied and sometimes competing understandings of the endeavour held by those implementing the intervention. The paper examines the principles that underpin health promotion in the community setting, particularly the concepts of ownership, empowerment and participation, and their differential interpretation and employment by participants. The data illustrate how these varied understandings had implications for the joint planning and implementation of Breathing Space objectives. In addition, the different understandings raise questions about the appropriateness and viability of utilizing community development approaches in this context.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.4374302625656128, 0.4613482356071472, 0.3841053247451782, 0.5107011198997498, 0.39199236035346985, 0.39854609966278076, 0.5530195236206055, 0.551952600479126, 0.4078691005706787]"
4,"maternity shelter care for adolescents its effect on incidence of low birth weight A group of 112 pregnant adolescents residing in a maternity shelter was compared with a group of 113 pregnant adolescents residing in their own homes but receiving identical medical care. The sheltered group was made up of a particularly high-risk group: they were more likely to be black, unmarried, receiving public assistance, and registered later for prenatal care than the group living at home. Despite these differences, the sheltered group delivered significantly fewer infants of low birth weight and preterm gestation than the control group. Variables assessed in this study fail to explain this difference. It is concluded that the services offered in a maternity shelter can have a positive impact on the reduction of low birth weight deliveries in a group of high-risk patients. These results indicate that the social and behavioral correlates of low birth weight remain to be fully defined and understood.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.44140830636024475, 0.4715201258659363, 0.39711856842041016, 0.6040515899658203, 0.38483813405036926, 0.44765734672546387, 0.4663410484790802, 0.3974924087524414, 0.4206470847129822]"

This study explores generational differences among these youth, both within and across schools, to determine whether assimilation has positive or negative consequences in the long term for the Mexican American population as a whole. A series of logistic regression models with the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health revealed that rates of academic failure and risk of obesity were higher in the second generation of Mexican American youth, although these generational patterns varied by the interpersonal, behavioral, and demographic characteristics of the student bodies of the schools they attended.

6,"short and long term social outcomes following pediatric traumatic brain injury The social outcomes of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) were examined in a prospective, longitudinal study that included 53 children with severe TBI, 56 with moderate TBI, and 80 with orthopedic injuries, recruited between 6 and 12 years of age. Child and family functioning were assessed at baseline, at 6- and 12-month follow-ups, and at an extended follow-up a mean of 4 years post injury. Growth curve analyses revealed that pediatric TBI yields negative social outcomes that are exacerbated by family environments characterized by lower socioeconomic status, fewer family resources, and poorer family functioning. After controlling for group membership, age, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ, path analyses indicated that long-term social outcomes were accounted for in part by specific neurocognitive skills, including executive functions and pragmatic language, and by social problem-solving. Deficits in these domains among children with TBI are likely to reflect damage to a network of brain regions that have been implicated in social cognition.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.3958485424518585, 0.4690045714378357, 0.3676110804080963, 0.5147949457168579, 0.3823219835758209, 0.44688680768013, 0.5703802108764648, 0.5226963758468628, 0.38607725501060486]"

The purpose of the present study was to examine the utility of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) for understanding 5-A-Day intentions and behavior and to determine whether any of the TPB relationships were moderated by ethnicity or gender. A total of 413 participants completed a baseline TPB questionnaire and a fruit and vegetable consumption measure 2 weeks later. Path analyses showed that affective attitude and perceived behavioral control significantly predicted intention for blacks, whites, males and females (R(2) ranged from .32 to .40), whereas subjective norm was a significant predictor for blacks, males, and females only. Intention significantly predicted 5-A-Day (R(2) ranged from .17 to .22) for all groups. Follow-up invariance analyses showed that the subjective norm/intention relationship was significantly stronger for black compared to white students. Finally, several key beliefs were identified for all four demographic groups. Therefore, the current results suggest that the TPB may be a useful framework to utilize when developing 5-A-Day interventions.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.40935376286506653, 0.4544042646884918, 0.43224000930786133, 0.48353496193885803, 0.41202038526535034, 0.4118702709674835, 0.573884129524231, 0.5141322612762451, 0.41041237115859985]"
8,"worker produced health education material for the construction trades There is broad acceptance of the philosophic foundations of health education as grounded in the collaborative model of client and professional partnership. In practice, however, this partnership is largely dominated by the professional side. Workers may be particularly sensitive to professional domination as issues associated with health promotion vs. safety and health programs at the workplace are often politicized. This polarization is particularly evident in the area of asbestos-related hazard prevention, reduction, and education. Using asbestos hazards as the unifying theme, we participated in a program to facilitate active participation of workers in the production of their own occupational health education materials through the use of the photonovel. Representatives from some seven building trade locals worked with a staff to produce a twenty-four-page photonovel for their co-workers. A random sample of 500 members of building trades locals received either a copy of the photonovel or a popular NCI asbestos pamphlet with an evaluation questionnaire. Differences between the groups were evident in favor of the photonovel in readability, factual recall, general credibility, and attitudes toward future involvement in health and safety issues.","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.5069798827171326, 0.4763081669807434, 0.4231095612049103, 0.6019964218139648, 0.4271988272666931, 0.471989244222641, 0.44904711842536926, 0.44706952571868896, 0.42168718576431274]"

Using responses to a population survey of US adults, we analysed demographic patterns of exposure to, searching for and sharing of e-cigarette-related information across media platforms. Methods An online survey of 17 522 US adults was conducted in 2013. The nationally representative sample was drawn from GfK Group9s KnowledgePanel plus off-panel recruitment. Fixed effects logit models were applied to analyse relationships between exposure to, searching for and sharing of e-cigarette-related information and demographic characteristics, e-cigarette and tobacco use, and media behaviours. Results High levels of awareness about e-cigarettes were indicated (86% aware; 47% heard through media channels). Exposure to e-cigarette-related information was associated with tobacco use, age, gender, more education, social media use and time spent online. Although relatively small proportions of the sample had searched for (∼5%) or shared (∼2%) e-cigarette information, our analyses indicated demographic patterns to those behaviours. Gender, high income and using social media were associated with searching for e-cigarette information; lesbian, gay and bisexual and less education were associated with sharing. Current tobacco use, age, being Hispanic and time spent online were associated with both searching and sharing. Conclusions US adults are widely exposed to e-cigarette marketing through the media; such marketing may differentially target specific demographic groups. Further research should longitudinally examine how exposure to, searching for and sharing of e-cigarette information relate to subsequent use of e-cigarettes and/or combustible tobacco.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.38975000381469727, 0.48356571793556213, 0.3702586889266968, 0.4870515763759613, 0.3757535219192505, 0.4056367874145508, 0.5754764676094055, 0.5532405376434326, 0.4069348871707916]"
10,"tackling inequalities in health evaluating the new deal for communities initiative Objective: To assess health improvement and differential changes in health across various sociodemographic groups in neighbourhood renewal areas. Design and setting: A longitudinal survey of 10 390 residents in New Deal for Communities (NDC) areas and 977 residents in comparator areas in England. Measures and methods: Changes on several outcomes across five domains (health, unemployment, education, crime and the physical environment) were assessed by sex, age, educational and ethnic group. Results: Small overall improvements were seen on all domains in NDC areas but similar improvements were also seen in comparator areas. In NDC areas, higher educational groups were more likely to stop smoking, less likely to develop a limiting long-term illness, more likely to find employment and more likely to participate in education or training (p for trend <0.05). Older people and women were less likely to find employment and experienced smaller increases in income. These patterns were generally mirrored in comparator areas, although the education gradient in participation in education or training was less steep in NDC areas. Conclusions: Evidence from two-year follow-up does not support an NDC effect, either overall or for particular population groups. Residents with lower education experienced the least favourable health profiles at baseline and the smallest improvements. Programme leaders should consider how to encourage participation among those with the lowest education. A shallower social gradient in participation in education and training in NDC areas and a lack of gradient in income, crime and environmental outcomes indicate that some aspects of the programme may be reaching all sections of the community.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.41115516424179077, 0.5345285534858704, 0.4489218592643738, 0.5480203032493591, 0.35979777574539185, 0.5401291847229004, 0.5297478437423706, 0.44762924313545227, 0.4123704433441162]"

14,"increasing uptake of hiv testing and counseling among the poorest in sub saharan countries through home based service provision The rapid expansion of HIV treatment is an important response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan countries. However, enrollment of infected individuals in treatment programs continues to be hampered by the low uptake of HIV testing and counseling (HTC). Furthermore, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in sub-Saharan African countries have identified a strong socioeconomic gradient in uptake of HTC.1–4 A significant fraction of the most vulnerable households may thus be excluded from the potential benefits stemming from the knowledge of one s HIV status—such as the adoption of strategies to reduce HIV transmission to partners and children—and the benefits associated with anti-retroviral treatment—such as increased survival and labor productivity.5–8 Poor accessibility of health facilities, fatalism, HIV-related stigma and confidentiality are the main barriers to use of HTC services in African countries.9 While several strategies to increase the uptake of HTC among sub-Saharan populations have been suggested,10 their impact on the poorest may be limited. Routine testing in hospitals and other health care facilities, for example, significantly increases uptake and case-finding among the attendees of these facilities,11–13 but cost and convenience issues often limit the use of healthcare facilities among the lower socioeconomic strata in sub-Saharan countries.1,2 HTC uptake is also increased through workplace-based initiatives,14 but such strategies similarly do not reach the poorest members of society who are often unemployed or employed in the informal sector. To overcome these limitations, the home-based provision of HTC services has recently been proposed as a strategy to attain “universal HIV testing and counseling” in Africa.15 Indeed, community-based approaches—like mobile HTC units or home-based HTC provision—have been shown to dramatically increase the uptake of testing services.16–20 However, previous studies have not documented whether the provision of home-based HTC may reduce the socioeconomic gradient in HTC uptake observed in sub-Saharan countries. The objectives of this study are to measure the uptake of home-based HTC among different socioeconomic groups on Likoma, and to assess whether the home-based provision of HTC services has the potential to reduce inequalities in access to, and uptake of, HTC.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.43180710077285767, 0.46037858724594116, 0.38935017585754395, 0.5136182904243469, 0.37513306736946106, 0.42635995149612427, 0.5639464259147644, 0.5493586659431458, 0.4051010012626648]"
15,"health promotion in older chinese a 12 month cluster randomized controlled trial of pedometry and peer support Aging, in conjunction with decreasing physical activity, is associated with a range of health problems. Simple, low-maintenance, population-based means of promoting activity to counteract the age-associated decline are required. We therefore assessed the effect of pedometry and buddy support to increase physical activity. Methods: We undertook a clustered randomized trial (HKCTR-346) of 24 community centers involving 399 older Chinese participants (>=60 yr). Centers were randomly allocated to 1) pedometry and buddy, 2) pedometry and no buddy, 3) no pedometry and buddy, and 4) no pedometry and no buddy with a 2 x 2 factorial design. The trial simultaneously tested the individual and combined effects of the interventions. The intervention groups also received monthly organized group activities to provide encouragement and support. Outcome measures were assessed at 6 and 12 months, including physical fitness and activity and cardiovascular disease risk factors (anthropometry and blood pressure). Results: From the 24 centers, 356 volunteers (89.2%) completed the study. Those receiving the interventions had higher mean physical activity levels at 12 months of 1820 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1360-2290) and 1260 (95% CI = 780-1740) MET[middle dot]min[middle dot]wk-1, respectively relative to the decrease in the control groups. The buddy peer support intervention significantly improved mean aerobic fitness (12% [95% CI = 4%-21%]) and reduced both body fat (-0.6% [95% CI = -1.1% to 0.0%]) and time to complete the 2.5-m get-up-and-go test (-0.27 [95% CI = -0.53 to -0.01] s). No other improvements in the cardiovascular disease risk factors were observed. The combination of motivational tools was no better than the individual interventions. Conclusions: Both motivational interventions increased physical activity levels, and the buddy style improved fitness. These tools could be useful adjuncts in the prevention of obesity and age-related complications.

The study is based on data collected with a mailed questionnaire at baseline and at a 5-year follow-up (after intervention) posted to 195 people aged 65+ in a residential area in a medium-sized Swedish town, rather typical for Northern Europe. Appreciation of the environment was analysed overall and in sub-groups. Overall appreciation was higher for women, in particular as regards longer green time at signalised crossings, and for those reporting better perceived health, in particular concerning separation between bicyclists and pedestrians. As concerns changes in perceived difficulty as pedestrians and in outdoor activity, no differences were found, either overall or in sub-groups.

Design Limited prospective study. Setting A regional infertility clinic and antenatal clinic. Patient(s) Seventy women who had conceived through assisted reproductive technology and 111 women who had conceived naturally. Intervention(s) Measures of self-esteem, anxiety, and parenting self-efficacy. Main Outcome Measure(s) Self-esteem, anxiety, and parenting self-efficacy. Result(s) Women who had conceived through IVF treatment did not differ in terms of self-esteem during pregnancy from those who had conceived naturally. All of the women in the present study displayed levels of self-esteem that were within the normal range. Self-esteem increased as pregnancy progressed. Self-esteem was negatively correlated with anxiety during pregnancy. As self-esteem increased, anxiety decreased. Self-esteem at the start of pregnancy (18 weeks) and anxiety in the early stages of parenthood (6 weeks postpartum) predicted parenting self-efficacy. Conclusion(s) Self-esteem in the early stages of pregnancy, for both women who conceived through IVF and women who conceived naturally, is related to self-reported levels of parenting efficacy.

20,"the impact of macromastia on adolescents a cross sectional study OBJECTIVE: To determine the physical and psychosocial impact of macromastia on adolescents considering reduction mammaplasty in comparison with healthy adolescents. METHODS: The following surveys were administered to adolescents with macromastia and control subjects, aged 12 to 21 years: Short-Form 36v2, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Breast-Related Symptoms Questionnaire, and Eating-Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26). Demographic variables and self-reported breast symptoms were compared between the 2 groups. Linear regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for BMI category (normal weight, overweight, obese), were fit to determine the effect of case status on survey score. Odds ratios for the risk of disordered eating behaviors (EAT-26 score ≥20) in cases versus controls were also determined. RESULTS: Ninety-six subjects with macromastia and 103 control subjects participated in this study. Age was similar between groups, but subjects with macromastia had a higher BMI ( P = .02). Adolescents with macromastia had lower Short-Form 36v2 domain, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Breast-Related Symptoms Questionnaire scores and higher EAT-26 scores compared with controls. Macromastia was also associated with a higher risk of disordered eating behaviors. In almost all cases, the impact of macromastia was independent of BMI category. CONCLUSIONS: Macromastia has a substantial negative impact on health-related quality of life, self-esteem, physical symptoms, and eating behaviors in adolescents with this condition. These observations were largely independent of BMI category. Health care providers should be aware of these important negative health outcomes that are associated with macromastia and consider early evaluation for adolescents with this condition. * Abbreviations: BRSQ — : Breast-Related Symptoms Questionnaire EAT-26 — : Eating Attitudes Test-26 HRQOL — : health-related quality of life RSES — : Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale OR — : odds ratio SF-36 — : Short-Form 36v2","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.5102757811546326, 0.5388807058334351, 0.41872715950012207, 0.5945254564285278, 0.4160608947277069, 0.5228687524795532, 0.4463207721710205, 0.4169088900089264, 0.4448931813240051]"

23,"evaluation of a home based voluntary counselling and testing intervention in rural uganda BACKGROUND Uptake of HIV test results from an annual serosurvey of a population study cohort in rural southwestern Uganda had never exceeded 10% in any given year since inception in 1989. An intervention offering counselling and HIV results at home was conducted in four study villages following the 2001 serosurvey round, and followed by a qualitative evaluation exploring nature of demand and barriers to knowing HIV status. METHODS Data from annual serosurveys and counsellor records are analyzed to estimate the impact of the intervention on uptake of HIV test results. Textual data are analyzed from 21 focus group discussions among counsellors, and men and women who had received HIV test results, requested but not yet received, and never requested; and 34 in-depth interviews equally divided among those who had received test results either from counselling offices and homes. RESULTS Offering HIV results at home significantly increased uptake of results from 10 to 37% for all adults aged 15 (p<0.001), and 46% of those age 25 to 54. Previous male advantage in uptake of test results was effectively eliminated. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews highlight substantial non-monetary costs of getting HIV results from high-visibility public facilities prior to intervention. Inconvenience, fear of stigmatization, and emotional vulnerability of receiving results from public facilities were the most common explanations for the relative popularity of home-based voluntary counselling and testing (VCT). It is seen as less appropriate for youth and couples with conflicting attitudes toward testing. CONCLUSIONS Home delivery of results revealed significantly higher demand to know HIV status than stubbornly low uptake figures from the past would suggest. Integrating VCT into other services, locating testing centres in less visible surroundings, or directly confronting stigma surrounding testing may be less expensive ways to reproduce increased uptake with home VCT.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.42385154962539673, 0.45785126090049744, 0.36378857493400574, 0.5387241244316101, 0.35661643743515015, 0.5242106318473816, 0.5079696178436279, 0.5044498443603516, 0.3801576793193817]"

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare an Internet coping skills training (TEENCOPE) intervention to an Internet educational intervention (Managing Diabetes) for adolescents with T1D. Moderators of program efficacy were evaluated. METHODS The study was a multisite clinical trial (n = 320) with data collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.

Data were analyzed using mixed-model analyses with an intent-to-treat approach. RESULTS There were no significant between-group treatment effects 6 months postintervention on primary outcomes. The Managing Diabetes youth showed a significant increase in social competence compared to the TEENCOPE youth. There were significant time effects for TEENCOPE (decreased stress and increased coping) and Managing Diabetes (improved diabetes quality of life).

28,"what happens when schools shut down investigating inequality in students reading behavior during covid 19 in denmark Abstract The outbreak of Covid-19 in spring 2020 shut down schools around the world and placed parents in charge of their children’s schooling. Research from the lockdown period documents that families differ in their responses to their new responsibility for their children’s homeschooling by socioeconomic status and that the Covid-19 crisis has increased educational inequality. The aim of this paper is to examine inequality in children’s reading behavior before, during and after the lockdown of schools in Denmark by analyzing new digital data from a widely used reading app combined with administrative data. Our results show, first, that students’ online reading behavior increased significantly as a consequence of the lockdown of schools, second, that there is a socioeconomic gradient in students’ reading behavior both before and during the lockdown, and, third, that inequality in reading behavior during Covid-19 increased exclusively during the first lockdown period in which schools were closed and students where taught online. Consequently, our results support the findings from previous research documenting a SES gradient in learning opportunities in homeschooling activities during the Covid-19 induced lockdown. Yet, contrary to prior research, we find only a short-term increase in inequality on children’s actual reading activity during Covid-19.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.441655695438385, 0.4686328172683716, 0.39109113812446594, 0.4653381407260895, 0.3749425709247589, 0.3787541091442108, 0.584025502204895, 0.5370655059814453, 0.42244336009025574]"

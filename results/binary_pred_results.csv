Methods  Using standardized computer-based prospective documentation, HbA1c, insulin dose, body mass index–standard deviation score (BMI–SDS), rate of hypoglycaemia, rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and intensity of care were analysed in 434 matched pairs during a follow-up period of 3 years after initiation of MDI or CSII.    Results  HbA1c was significantly lower in the CSII group during the first year of new regimen (CSII 7.5 ± 0.05 vs. MDI 7.7 ± 0.06; P < 0.05), but rose to the same level as in the MDI group during year 3. Insulin requirement remained significantly lower in the CSII group. The BMI–SDS increased in both study groups, with no significant difference. The rate of severe hypoglycaemia decreased significantly after the change of regimen (CSII 17.87 ± 2.85 vs. MDI 25.14 ± 3.79; P < 0.05) and during year 3 of the regimen, particularly when compared with baseline (−21% vs. −16%). The rate of DKA was lower at baseline in the CSII group and remained significantly lower over all 3 years. Intensity of care was the same in both subsets.    Conclusions  Employing a large cohort, this matched-pair analysis has demonstrated over a 3-year study period that CSII is a safe form of intensive insulin therapy with similar glycaemic effects, but with significantly reduced rates of hypoglycaemia and DKA and a lower insulin requirement when compared with MDI.

2,"fruit and vegetable consumption nutritional knowledge and beliefs in mothers and children Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is an important health behaviour. Parental and other psychosocial influences on children s fruit and vegetable consumption are poorly understood. The contribution of a variety of psychosocial and environmental factors to consumption of fruit and vegetables by children aged 9-11 years was explored. Ninety-two mothers and children (48 girls and 44 boys) were recruited via urban primary health-care practices. Socio-economic and educational level, nutritional knowledge and health- and diet-related beliefs and attitudes were assessed in mothers and children by questionnaires and semistructured interviews. Mothers  diets were measured by a food frequency questionnaire, while children s diets were assessed by 3-day diaries (N = 80). The pattern of influence of the various measures on fruit and vegetable consumption was compared with that on children s confectionery intake. The children s intakes of macronutrients were typical for the U.K. (37% fat, 50% carbohydrate and 13% protein by energy; 12 g/day fibre), while median fruit, fruit juice and vegetable intake amounted to about 2.5 servings/day. Univariate correlations and subsequent multiple regression analyses revealed quite different influences on the three food types. Independent predictors of children s fruit intake included mothers nutritional knowledge (beta = 0.37), mothers  frequency of fruit consumption (beta = 0.30) and mothers  attitudinal conviction that increasing fruit and vegetable consumption by their children could reduce their risk of developing cancer (beta = 0.27; multiple beta = 0.37, p<0.0001). Children s vegetable consumption was independently explained by the child s liking for commonly eaten vegetables (beta = 0.36) and the mother s belief in the importance of disease prevention when choosing her child s food (beta = - 0.27; r(2) = 0.20, p<0.001). Children s confectionery consumption was predicted by the mother s liking for confectionery (beta=0.32) and the children s concern for health in choosing what to eat (beta =-0.26, r(2) = 0.16, p<0.005). Children s consumption of fruit and vegetables are related to different psychosocial and environmental factors. Promotion of this behaviour may require attention to nutritional education and child feeding strategies of parents. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

3,"scaling up pediatric hiv testing by incorporating provider initiated hiv testing into all child health services in hurungwe district zimbabwe BACKGROUND Practical ways are needed to scale-up pediatric HIV testing in sub-Saharan Africa, where testing is usually limited to HIV-exposed children in maternal and child health clinics. METHODS We implemented an enhanced pediatric HIV testing program in 33 health facilities in Zimbabwe by integrating HIV testing into all pediatric health services. We collected individual data on children tested by having health care workers complete a program-specific child health booklet. We compared numbers of children tested before and during the program using routinely collected aggregate program data reported by health facilities. RESULTS A total of 12,556 children aged 0-5 years were recorded in child health booklets; 9431 (75.1%) had information on HIV testing, of whom 7326 (77.7%) were tested; 7167 had test results of whom 122 (1.7%) were HIV-infected. Among children seen in outpatient clinics, 82.1% were tested compared with 66.5% tested among children seen in maternal/child health clinics. Of the 122 HIV-infected children identified, 77 (63.1%) could be missed under existing pediatric testing guidelines. The number of HIV-infected children identified during the 6-month program increased by 55% compared with the prior 6-month period (RR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.96). Factors independently associated with HIV infection included being malnourished (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.7, 95% CI: 2.1 to 28.6), being exposed to TB (AOR = 8.1, 95% CI: 2.0 to 32.2), and having an HIV-infected mother (AOR = 41.6, 95% CI: 15.9 to 108.8). CONCLUSIONS Integrating HIV testing into all pediatric health services is feasible and can assist in identifying HIV-infected children who could be missed in current testing guidelines.

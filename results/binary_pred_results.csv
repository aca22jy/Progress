0,"electronic cigarettes in canada prevalence of use and perceptions among youth and young adults OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence and perceptions of electronic cigarette use among Canadian youth and young adults. METHODS: A sample of 1,188 youth and young adults age 16-30 years were recruited from an online panel of Canadians in 2012. After viewing an image of an e-cigarette, respondents answered questions regarding their use and perceptions of e-cigarettes. RESULTS: Close to half of respondents (43.4%) had seen e-cigarettes advertised or for sale. A total of 16.1% reported trying an e-cigarette (5.2% nonsmokers, 18.9% former smokers, and 34.5% current smokers), and 5.7% reported use in the past 30 days (0.8% non-smokers, 1.4% former smokers, and 15.0% current smokers). Compared to non-smokers, former smokers and current smokers were more likely to have tried e-cigarettes (OR=4.25 and OR=9.84, respectively), and current smokers were more likely to have tried e-cigarettes than former smokers (OR=2.32). Current smokers were also more likely to be current users of e-cigarettes than both former smokers (OR=15.15) and non-smokers (OR=4.43). Smokers were interested in trying e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking (80.4%), as a long-term replacement for cigarettes (77.8%), or to use in places where they cannot smoke (80.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of e-cigarettes among surveyed youth and young adults is quite high. Almost one fifth (16.1%) of participants reported trying e-cigarettes, with evidence of use among non-smokers.

1,"de madres a madres a community primary health care program based on empowerment Based on the concepts of empowerment of indigenous women through unity, validation of women as key health promoters, and the acceptance of a community s ability to identify and redress its own health needs, the de Madres a Madres Program was started in a Houston inner-city Hispanic community. The program has become a strategy for mobilizing a total community for health. Indigenous volunteer mothers learned how to provide information to increase access to health care. Information was provided through community coalitions the mothers formed with health clinics, social service agencies, local businesses, schools, churches, elected officials, and the media. Outcome data identified the covert functions of the program to be the enhancement of individual women s self-esteem and power, and the collective enhancement of community self-esteem, power, and economy. The concept of a community economy and a theoretical basis of empowerment of women are discussed in terms of community empowerment for community health.

2,"understanding the relationship between parental income and multiple child outcomes a decomposition analysis In this paper we explore the association between family income and children’s cognitive ability (IQ and school performance), socio-emotional outcomes (self esteem, locus of control and behavioural problems) and physical health (risk of obesity). We develop a decomposition technique that allows us to compare the relative importance of the adverse family characteristics and home environments of low income children in accounting for different outcomes. Using rich cohort data from the UK we find that poor children are disadvantaged at age 7 to 9 across the full spectrum of outcomes, the gradient being strongest for cognitive outcomes and weakest for physical health. We find that some aspects of environment appear to be associated with the full range of outcomes - for example, maternal smoking and breastfeeding, child nutrition, parental psychological functioning. We also find some some aspects of the environment of higher income households hinder child development. We conclude that many aspects of growing up in poverty are harmful to children’s development, and that narrowly-targeted interventions are unlikely to have a significant impact on intergenerational mobility.

3,"the finnmark intervention study better health for the fishery population in an arctic village in north norway Objective - To evaluate the lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factor changes after 6 years of intervention in the North Cape community. Design - Longitudinal cohort study with a quasi-experimental design with one intervention and three control communities selected from the same coastal area with a baseline screening (1987), 6-year intervention, and re-screening (1993). Setting - Fishing communities on the coast of Finnmark in the Norwegian Arctic area. Participants - 1685 (70%) of the invited in both screenings, aged between 20 and 62 years in 1987. Intervention - Community-intervention based on empowerment and cooperation between voluntary organisations and local health services. Main outcome measures - Change in cardiovascular risk factors. Results - Compared to the control communities, the main findings in North Cape were among men: 21.3% less drinking boiled coffee (p < 0.05), 10.5% more drinking low fat milk (p < 0.01), 0.3 mmol/l reduction in cholesterol (p < 0.01) and 0.2 kg/m2 reduction in BMI (p ...

0,"sensor augmented pump therapy for a1c reduction star 3 study results from the 6 month continuation phase OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of crossing over from optimized multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy to sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy for 6 months, and the effects of 18 months sustained use of SAP. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The 6-month, single-crossover continuation phase of Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy for A1C Reduction (STAR 3) provided SAP therapy to 420 subjects who completed the 1-year randomized study. The primary outcome was change in A1C in the crossover group. RESULTS A1C values were initially lower in the continuing-SAP group than in the crossover group (7.4 vs. 8.0%, P < 0.001). A1C values remained reduced in the SAP group. After 3 months on the SAP system, A1C decreased to 7.6% in the crossover group (P < 0.001); this was a significant and sustained decrease among both adults and children (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Switching from optimized MDI to SAP therapy allowed for rapid and safe A1C reductions. Glycemic benefits of SAP therapy persist for at least 18 months.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.5069981813430786, 0.5237159132957458, 0.4623657166957855, 0.4466073513031006, 0.4801046848297119, 0.42049720883369446, 0.4178462624549866, 0.518471360206604, 0.4390394389629364]"

2,"por la vida model intervention enhances use of cancer screening tests among latinas Abstract Objectives: To describe the short-term impact of the intervention known as Por La Vida (PLV) on cancer screening for Latinas in San Diego, California. Methods: Thirty-six lay community workers (consejeras) were recruited and trained to conduct educational group sessions. Each consejera recruited approximately 14 peers from the community to participate in the program. The consejeras were randomly assigned to either a twelve-week cancer screening intervention group or a control group in which they participated in an equally engaging program entitled “Community Living Skills.” Pre- and post-intervention self-report information was obtained from project participants on the use of cancer screening examinations. Outcome measures were changes in the percentages of women who had breast and cervical cancer screening tests within the past year before and after the intervention occurred. Experimental and control groups were compared using t-tests. Analyses were conducted using both consejeras and participants as the unit of analysis. Results: The increase in the use of the cancer screening tests was higher in the PLV cancer intervention group in comparison to women in the community living skills control group. Conclusions: Key to the PLV intervention model is the identification of natural helpers in the Latino community and their subsequent training in interventions based on social learning theory using culturally appropriate educational materials. The model is an effective and viable approach for increasing the use of cancer screening tests in Latinas of low socioeconomic level and low level of acculturation.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.5042648315429688, 0.660502552986145, 0.42179450392723083, 0.43596869707107544, 0.4941311776638031, 0.40622782707214355, 0.46634000539779663, 0.46772727370262146, 0.404529333114624]"
3,"understanding the relationship between parental income and multiple child outcomes a decomposition analysis In this paper we explore the association between family income and children’s cognitive ability (IQ and school performance), socio-emotional outcomes (self esteem, locus of control and behavioural problems) and physical health (risk of obesity). We develop a decomposition technique that allows us to compare the relative importance of the adverse family characteristics and home environments of low income children in accounting for different outcomes. Using rich cohort data from the UK we find that poor children are disadvantaged at age 7 to 9 across the full spectrum of outcomes, the gradient being strongest for cognitive outcomes and weakest for physical health. We find that some aspects of environment appear to be associated with the full range of outcomes - for example, maternal smoking and breastfeeding, child nutrition, parental psychological functioning. We also find some some aspects of the environment of higher income households hinder child development. We conclude that many aspects of growing up in poverty are harmful to children’s development, and that narrowly-targeted interventions are unlikely to have a significant impact on intergenerational mobility.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.47731462121009827, 0.6877524852752686, 0.4660758674144745, 0.46012941002845764, 0.5182672739028931, 0.37134799361228943, 0.43931475281715393, 0.48576781153678894, 0.3635093569755554]"

The study is based on data collected with a mailed questionnaire at baseline and at a 5-year follow-up (after intervention) posted to 195 people aged 65+ in a residential area in a medium-sized Swedish town, rather typical for Northern Europe. Appreciation of the environment was analysed overall and in sub-groups. Overall appreciation was higher for women, in particular as regards longer green time at signalised crossings, and for those reporting better perceived health, in particular concerning separation between bicyclists and pedestrians. As concerns changes in perceived difficulty as pedestrians and in outdoor activity, no differences were found, either overall or in sub-groups. However, the study identifies which environmental measures older people appreciate, indicating that certain sub-groups may benefit more from interventions in the outdoor environment.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.494093120098114, 0.6126850247383118, 0.4742142856121063, 0.42978358268737793, 0.46435463428497314, 0.3881055414676666, 0.40721312165260315, 0.517782986164093, 0.4354120194911957]"

A total of 185 mothers were recruited in the antenatal period to a controlled trial of an early parenting intervention. They were interviewed at home when the baby was aged around one month, and completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12) and the Parenting Daily Hassles Scale. Almost half of mothers reported psychological distress above the accepted GHQ12 cut-off point. However, distress was not related to variables such as low socio-economic status, as had been predicted. Early parenting stress was greater in relatively more educated and older mothers. New motherhood is likely to be stressful, even where mothers do not have postpartum depression, and so a range of supports is required.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.5166245102882385, 0.6087598204612732, 0.46380677819252014, 0.4439459443092346, 0.459116131067276, 0.3945819139480591, 0.4386783838272095, 0.46462833881378174, 0.4576113522052765]"
7,"health related quality of life of children and adolescents after traumatic brain injury Objective. Relatively little is known about the longer-term impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on children’s daily functioning, especially the broader outcome domain referred to as health-related quality of life (HRQL). The objective of the present study was to examine the nature and predictors of HRQL outcomes in children with moderate to severe TBI an average of 4 years postinjury. Methods. The study used a concurrent cohort-prospective design involving postinjury assessments of 3 groups of traumatically injured children and their families including 42 with severe TBI, 42 with moderate TBI, and 50 with orthopedic injuries only. Parent and child perceptions of HRQL and child adaptive behavior measures were obtained along with parent descriptions of the child’s health problems and use of medical and mental health services. Predictors included indices of injury severity, social factors, and ratings of preinjury child behavior problems and school performance. Results. Based on parent report, adolescents who sustained severe TBI had lower HRQL related to overall psychosocial functioning and in the domains of behavior, mental health, general health, and family impact than adolescents who sustained orthopedic injuries only. Communication skills, daily living skills, and general adaptive functioning also were rated lower in the severe TBI group. In contrast to parent reports, adolescents with severe TBI did not rate their HRQL in most domains differently than did adolescents with orthopedic injuries. There were no group differences in frequency of persistent physical limitations. Sixty-seven percent of families of children with severe TBI used mental health counseling at some point after the injury. Risks for poorer HRQL outcomes were related to family social disadvantage and poorer preinjury child behavioral and academic functioning. Conclusions. Findings underscore the importance of using comprehensive measures of HRQL, along with traditional indicators of functional outcomes, when evaluating the longer-term impact of injuries in children. Identification of predictors suggests the need for close monitoring and intervention of high-risk children.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.4818234443664551, 0.7109021544456482, 0.45140954852104187, 0.44631242752075195, 0.5396476984024048, 0.400748074054718, 0.4348292350769043, 0.470234215259552, 0.3409079313278198]"
8,"survival from cancer of the lung in england and wales up to 2001 Lung cancer is still the most common cancer in the world. Following the steady decline in incidence in men in England and Wales for over 20 years, it is now the second most common cancer in men (19 000 cases a year, 8% lifetime risk) after prostate cancer, and it causes 17 000 deaths a year. In women, the long-term increase in incidence has recently flattened off, but lung cancer is now the third most common cancer (13 000 cases a year, 4% lifetime risk) after cancers of the breast and large bowel, and it causes 11 500 deaths a year (Quinn et al, 2001; Office for National Statistics, 2005). Lung cancer is the commonest cause of death from cancer in both men and women. Most lung cancers are caused by tobacco smoking, and incidence trends follow the trends of tobacco consumption, with an approximate 20-year time lag. In turn, mortality trends closely mirror the lung cancer incidence trends, with very little time lag, because survival has been so poor for so long. Lung cancer alone accounts for approximately 5% of all deaths in England and Wales. Screening has not been shown to reduce mortality. Survival from lung cancer has not improved much for decades, and even in European countries with the highest survival, 5-year relative survival remains less than 15% (Berrino et al, 1995b; Sant et al, 2003). The most deprived group has a lung cancer incidence almost double that of the most affluent group, in both men and women (Quinn et al, 2001). Trends in incidence show a decline of approximately 20% since the late 1980s in men, and a plateau in the late 1990s for women: the trends are parallel, affecting all socioeconomic groups about equally (data not shown). The survival analyses reported here relate to 392 000 patients diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive malignancy of the trachea, bronchus or lung in England and Wales during the period 1986–1999, who were followed up to 31 December 2001, some 79% of the 497 000 patients potentially eligible for inclusion. Of these, 1.5% were excluded because their vital status was unknown at 5 November 2002, when the data were extracted for analysis, and a further 16% because their survival was unknown (or zero): most of those were registered solely from a death certificate. A further 16 000 (3.2%) patients were excluded because they previously had cancer in another organ at some time since 1971. Lung cancers assigned to the upper lobe comprised 23% of cases in the late 1980s, rising to 29% by the late 1990s, with a commensurate drop in the proportion with an unspecified lobe of origin, from 54 to 46%, suggesting improvement in the recording of pathology rather than changing patterns of disease. The lower lobe accounted for 12% of cases and the middle lobe 3%, with 8% assigned to the main bronchus. Bronchus and lung cancers predominate: those of the trachea accounted for only 0.3% of cases, unchanged since the 1970s. Approximately 28% were papillary or squamous carcinomas, 13% small cell or oat cell carcinomas and 12% adenocarcinomas, but 40% were poorly specified carcinomas.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.4964667558670044, 0.6386004090309143, 0.45697352290153503, 0.45249247550964355, 0.4710359573364258, 0.38031280040740967, 0.4085122048854828, 0.4952937960624695, 0.4358517825603485]"

Methods The effectiveness of promotores de salud (community health workers) in improving heart-healthy behaviors among Latino families participating in the pilot program at seven sites was evaluated. Data on the characteristics of the promotores in the Salud Para Su Corazon program were compiled. Promotores collected data on family risk factors, health habits, referrals and screenings, information sharing, and program satisfaction from 223 participating Latino families (320 individual family members) through questionnaires. Paired t tests and chi-square tests were used to measure pretest-posttest differences among program participants.

Additionally, longitudinal increases in percentage of MVPA and more favorable rating of the neighborhood as a place to walk were both associated with decreased group ORA use. Better understanding how social and physical environmental characteristics impact ORA use for PA can lead to more effective intervention strategies and warrants greater attention in future research and public health promotion efforts.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.48841604590415955, 0.6325896382331848, 0.4761045575141907, 0.4290391504764557, 0.47283685207366943, 0.3731042146682739, 0.4100654125213623, 0.5055863261222839, 0.42020943760871887]"
14,"long term efficacy of insulin pump therapy in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus Objective: Insulin pumps have been well established for insulin delivery. However, questions about long-term efficacy of insulin pump therapy still remain. We evaluated the long-term efficacy of continuous insulin infusion pump therapy (CSII) in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: This was a retrospective observational study which included 131 patients with T1DM who transitioned to an insulin pump from multiple daily insulin (MDI) injections between 1999 and 2009 and were followed by one endocrinologist. Data were collected from 6 months prior to switching to CSII to 30 months after initiation of CSII and included glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin requirement. Of the 131 patients, 45 had complete data consisting of a visit and HbA1c every 6 months for 30 months after transition to CSII and were included for analysis. Results: Mean HbA1c prior to starting the CSII was 8.0 +0.9 %, 7.7 +1.0 % at 6 months and 7.8+1.2 % at 1 yr post initiation of CSII. However, at 30 months, HbA1c increased to 8.0+1.3%. A trend in transient improvement in HbA1c was limited only to those patients >11 yr of age and those requiring >0.75 u/kg/day of insulin at transition and was not seen in those <11 yr of age or those requiring <0.75 u/kg/day and did not persist beyond 1 year. Conclusions: There was no long-term significant difference in glycemic control in patients with CSII as compared to MDI.

15,an incentivized hiv counseling and testing program targeting hard to reach unemployed men in cape town south africa BACKGROUND: In Southern Africa men access HIV counseling and testing (HCT) services less than women. Innovative strategies are needed to increase uptake of testing among men. This study assessed the effectiveness of incentivized mobile HCT in reaching unemployed men in Cape Town South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of HCT data collected between August 2008 and August 2010 from adult men accessing clinic-based stationary and non-incentivized and incentivized mobile services. Data from these 3 services were analyzed using descriptive statistics and log-binomial regression models. RESULTS: A total of 9416 first-time testers were included in the analysis as follows: 708 were clinic based 4985 were non-incentivized and 3723 incentivized mobile service testers. A higher HIV prevalence was observed among men accessing incentivized mobile testing [16.6% (617/3723)] compared with those attending non-incentivized mobile [5.5% (277/4985)] and clinic-based services [10.2% (72/708)]. Among men testing at the mobile service greater proportions of men receiving incentives were self-reported first-time testers (60.1% vs. 42.0%) and had advanced disease (14.9% vs. 7.5%) compared with men testing at non-incentivized mobile services. Furthermore compared with the non-incentivized mobile service the incentivized service was associated with a 3-fold greater yield of newly diagnosed HIV infections. This strong association persisted in analyses adjusted for age and first-time versus repeat testing [risk ratio: 2.33 (95% confidence interval: 2.03 to 2.57); P < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that incentivized mobile testing services may reach more previously untested men and significantly increase detection of HIV infection in men.,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.4858652949333191, 0.6150911450386047, 0.46177905797958374, 0.42464494705200195, 0.47792357206344604, 0.4040434658527374, 0.43720167875289917, 0.49643054604530334, 0.42517969012260437]"

This study assessed the effects of the Health Works for Women (HWW) intervention on improving multiple behaviors including nutrition and physical activity among rural female blue-collar employees in North Carolina. Methods. Nine small to mid-size workplaces were randomly assigned to either intervention or delayed intervention conditions. After a baseline survey, an intervention consisting of two computer-tailored magazines and a natural helpers program was conducted over 18 months. Delayed worksites received one tailored magazine. Approximately 77 and 76% of baseline respondents completed follow-up surveys at 6 and 18 months, respectively, and 538 women (63%) completed all three surveys. Results. At the 18-month follow-up, the intervention group had increased fruit and vegetable consumption by 0.7 daily servings compared to no change in the delayed group (P < 0.05). Significant differences in fat intake were observed at 6 months (P < 0.05) but not at 18 months. The intervention group also demonstrated improvements in strengthening and flexibility exercise compared to the delayed group.

17,"evaluation of a pre existing 3 year household water treatment and handwashing intervention in rural guatemala Background The promotion of household water treatment and handwashing with soap has led to large reductions in child diarrhoea in randomized efficacy trials. Currently, we know little about the health effectiveness of behaviour-based water and hygiene interventions after the conclusion of intervention activities. Methods We present an extension of previously published design (propensity score matching) and analysis (targeted maximum likelihood estimation) methods to evaluate the behavioural and health impacts of a pre-existing but non-randomized intervention (a 3-year, combined household water treatment and handwashing campaign in rural Guatemala). Six months after the intervention, we conducted a cross-sectional cohort study in 30 villages (15 intervention and 15 control) that included 600 households, and 929 children <5 years of age. Results The study design created a sample of intervention and control villages that were comparable across more than 30 potentially confounding characteristics. The intervention led to modest gains in confirmed water treatment behaviour [risk difference = 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02–0.09]. We found, however, no difference between the intervention and control villages in self-reported handwashing behaviour, spot-check hygiene conditions, or the prevalence of child diarrhoea, clinical acute lower respiratory infections or child growth. Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first post-intervention follow-up study of a combined household water treatment and handwashing behaviour change intervention, and the first post-intervention follow-up of either intervention type to include child health measurement. The lack of child health impacts is consistent with unsustained behaviour adoption. Our findings highlight the difficulty of implementing behaviour-based household water treatment and handwashing outside of intensive efficacy trials.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.47589603066444397, 0.701461672782898, 0.4557919204235077, 0.42472201585769653, 0.48975542187690735, 0.38859376311302185, 0.42229723930358887, 0.4611692726612091, 0.3649437427520752]"
18,"insulin pump treatment increasing prevalence and predictors for better metabolic outcome in danish children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes Aims Few studies have looked at nationwide data for insulin pump treatment. Since 1996 the Danish Childhood Diabetes Registry (DanDiabKids) has collected data on all Danish diabetic patients aged 0–15 yr. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) use among Danish children with diabetes and to compare metabolic control in CSII-treated children and adolescents to those treated with MDI. Materials and methods The Registry collects on a yearly basis data on insulin regimen, central measured hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and demographic data on all patients. In the period 2005–2011, 2983 young patients (1721 males) with diabetes were followed in the Registry. Mean observation period was 5.11 yr [standard error (SE) 0.09]. In the total period 1846 patients were treated with MDI and 1493 changed from MDI to CSII. In 2005, less than 5% of children were treated with CSII whereas the percentage of children on CSII increased to approximately 50% in 2011. The patients were divided into age groups, 15 yr. Results HbA1c was significantly higher in MDI-treated children, +5.29 (CI 95% 4.29; 6.29 mmol/mol). HbA1c in all age groups was significantly lower in CSII-treated patients, and longitudinally HbA1c continued to be lower in all age groups. In multivariate analysis, a low HbA1c at CSII start, centers with more than 100 pump patients, a more recent year of diabetes onset, a higher number of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) measurements, a higher number of daily boluses, and a higher percentage of bolus insulin were all related to a lower HbA1c. Conclusion The percentage of children on pumps (CSII) is CSII treatment is associated with a significantly lower Hba1c, achieved just after treatment initiation. In the following years there is a parallel rise in HbA1c in both MDI as well as in MDI treated patients. Patients coming from larger clinics, and patients measuring more blood glucose values and taking more boluses have a better metabolic control.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.5085152387619019, 0.6628038883209229, 0.4397304356098175, 0.44567400217056274, 0.5204399228096008, 0.4108423590660095, 0.4458138048648834, 0.45044469833374023, 0.3733777105808258]"
19,"challenges in evaluating an arthritis self management program for people with hip and knee osteoarthritis in real world clinical settings Objective. To evaluate the influence of a 6-week Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and self-management skills in clinical settings. Methods. Individuals with hip or knee osteoarthritis referred to orthopedic surgeons or rheumatologists at 6 hospitals in Victoria, Australia, were recruited. In a randomized controlled trial, participants received the Stanford ASMP and self-help book (intervention) or book only (control). Assessments included the Assessment of Quality of Life instrument (AQoL; range −0.04 to 1.00) and Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ; range 1–6) at baseline and up to 12 months. The primary outcome was HRQOL at 12 months (assessed using the AQoL). Results. Recruitment was concluded early due to persistent challenges including infrequent referrals and patient inability or disinterest in participating. Of 1125 individuals screened, only 120 were randomized (control, n = 62; intervention, n = 58). Seven ASMP were conducted while 18 scheduled ASMP were cancelled. Forty-four of 58 intervention group participants received the intervention as allocated (76%); all control group participants were sent the book (100%). Ninety-four participants (78%) completed 12-month assessments (control, 90%; intervention, 66%). There was no difference in HRQOL at 12 months (adjusted mean difference −0.02, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.05). At 6 weeks, the intervention group reported higher heiQ skill and technique acquisition scores (adjusted mean difference 0.29, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.55); however, this dissipated by 3 months. Conclusion. Significant challenges hampered this evaluation of the ASMP.

20,"long term clinical benefits and costs of an integrated rehabilitation programme compared with outpatient physiotherapy for chronic knee pain Abstract Background Chronic knee pain is a major cause of disability in the elderly. Management guidelines recommend exercise and self-management interventions as effective treatments. The authors previously described a rehabilitation programme integrating exercise and self-management [Enabling Self-management and Coping with Arthritic knee Pain through Exercise (ESCAPE-knee pain)] that produced short-term improvements in pain and physical function, but sustaining these improvements is difficult. Moreover, the programme is untried in clinical environments, where it would ultimately be delivered. Objectives To establish the feasibility of ESCAPE-knee pain and compare its clinical effectiveness and costs with outpatient physiotherapy. Design Pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Setting Outpatient physiotherapy department and community centre. Participants Sixty-four people with chronic knee pain. Interventions Outpatient physiotherapy compared with ESCAPE-knee pain. Outcomes The primary outcome was physical function assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Secondary outcomes included pain, objective functional performance, anxiety, depression, exercise-related health beliefs and healthcare utilisation. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 months after completing the interventions (primary endpoint). ANCOVA investigated between-group differences. Results Both groups demonstrated similar improvements in clinical outcomes. Outpatient physiotherapy cost £130 per person and the healthcare utilisation costs of participants over 1 year were £583. The ESCAPE-knee pain programme cost £64 per person and the healthcare utilisation costs of participants over 1 year were £320. Conclusions ESCAPE-knee pain can be delivered as a community-based integrated rehabilitation programme for people with chronic knee pain. Both ESCAPE-knee pain and outpatient physiotherapy produced sustained physical and psychosocial benefits, but ESCAPE-knee pain cost less and was more cost-effective.

Methods: We analyzed data from the population-based Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) on 24,423 nulliparous women with single, term infants delivered between 1998 and 2000 in 19 states. We calculated BMI from self-reported weight and height. We assessed interactions between prepregnancy BMI and other risk factors. We estimated weighted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for the association between prepregnancy BMI and cesarean section from multiple logistic regression models adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors from the PRAMS questionnaire or birth certificates. Results: The incidence of cesarean delivery increased with increased prepregnancy BMI, from 14.3% (0.8 standard error (SE)) for lean women (BMI < 19.8) to 42.6% (2.0 SE) for very obese women (BMI ≥ 35).

Among women with any complication, the estimated adjusted RR for cesarean delivery was 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–1.2) among overweight women, 1.3 (95% CI 1.1–1.4) among obese women, and 1.4 (95% CI 1.2–1.6) among very obese women compared with normal weight women. Among women without any complications, the estimated adjusted RR was 1.4 (95% CI 1.0–1.8) among overweight women, 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.1) among obese women, and 3.1 (95% CI 2.3–4.8) among very obese women. Conclusion: Excess prepregnancy weight increases the risk of cesarean delivery among nulliparous women giving birth to single, term infants, especially among very obese women without any complications.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.4964459538459778, 0.6261520981788635, 0.4738832712173462, 0.4303087890148163, 0.45052140951156616, 0.382941871881485, 0.4385654032230377, 0.4749564230442047, 0.44081583619117737]"
27,"the protective influence of mentoring on adolescents substance use direct and indirect pathways A conceptual model was tested in which mentoring relationships were hypothesized to reduce substance use both directly and indirectly through improvements in adolescents self-perceptions and close relationships. The study included 928 young adolescents (M age = 12.25), all of whom applied to Big Brothers Big Sisters programs. The adolescents were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group and administered questions at baseline and 18 months later. The hypothesized model was not substantiated particularly well with data from the entire sample but was strongly supported when it was estimated with a subgroup of youth who were in longer lasting relationships. Being matched for longer than 12 months had significant impacts on the frequency of substance use and on parental relationships. Consistent with our conceptual model, parental relationships mediated the relationship between mentoring and substance use. Implications of these findings for research and interventions are discussed.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.5139593482017517, 0.608290433883667, 0.45613929629325867, 0.4381152391433716, 0.4673675298690796, 0.4143885374069214, 0.46018311381340027, 0.4747715890407562, 0.4383215308189392]"
28,"attitudes to hpv vaccination among ethnic minority mothers in the uk an exploratory qualitative study Objective: The objective of this study was to explore attitudes to HPV vaccination among Black and Asian mothers living in Britain.Design: This study used qualitative methodology. Face-to-face interviews were carried out with Black/Black British (n = 10) and Asian/Asian British mothers (n = 10). Interviews lasted approximately 40 minutes, were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis.Results: Five major themes emerged from the data: i) Experience of vaccination, ii) Awareness of HPV vaccination and reactions to the information, iii) reasons for giving vaccination, iv) concerns about vaccination and v) social influences. Visits to family abroad meant additional experience with vaccinations. There were concerns about how vaccine effects could vary by ethnicity as a result of physical differences (e.g. sickle-cell anaemia), and mothers wanted to know whether the HPV vaccine had been tested fully in their ethnic group. Most mothers struggled to understand why their da...","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.4896734654903412, 0.6236948370933533, 0.48359426856040955, 0.42862167954444885, 0.46176713705062866, 0.3658342957496643, 0.38711047172546387, 0.5127313733100891, 0.4387796223163605]"
29,"factors that influence the decision to undergo cosmetic breast augmentation surgery Background: This study examined the factors that motivate women to seek cosmetic breast augmentation surgery. Methods: Twenty-five breast augmentation surgery candidates completed measures of body image dissatisfaction, sociocultual influences on physical appearance, marital and sexual satisfaction, and self-report questionnaires that assessed other motivations for surgery. Thirty physically similar women who were not interested in breast augmentation also completed the measures. Results: Replicating previous studies, breast augmentation candidates, compared with controls, reported greater dissatisfaction with their breasts. The two groups, however, did not differ on overall body image dissatisfaction or greater awareness or internalization of sociocultural influences on physical appearance. Breast augmentation patients reported more positive sexual functioning compared with controls. Conclusions: Overall, breast augmentation patients appeared to be motivated by their feelings about their breasts rather t...","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.49623119831085205, 0.6203551292419434, 0.4665282070636749, 0.4344433844089508, 0.4516473114490509, 0.3913445472717285, 0.4490893483161926, 0.49299827218055725, 0.447579950094223]"

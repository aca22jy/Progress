0,"exclusion of certain groups from clinical research Recent evidence indicates that certain groups such as women, ethnic minorities, the elderly, and the poor may be underrepresented in clinical research. A review was conducted of 754 approved research protocols from one tertiary care center over a 2-year period (1989, 1990) to examine demographic characteristics of subjects. Most protocols (81.4%) included both men and women; 56.6% included people over age 65. About three-fourths described exclusionary criteria. Exclusions for which a justification was least frequently explicated were for age (44.9%), socioeconomic status (42.9%), and race (38.1%). In nursing protocols, only 26.6% included a justification for age. In this study, the elderly, poor and ethnic minorities were found to be excluded without identifiable justification from research protocols. While such disparities must be corrected, there are certain research design considerations that should be taken into account to assure that research questions are answered in the most efficient manner for the most representative group.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.46634188294410706, 0.44984978437423706, 0.4055114686489105, 0.3723750114440918, 0.36380869150161743, 0.38188374042510986, 0.5632072687149048, 0.33076319098472595, 0.5373370051383972]"
1,"drug prevention in a community setting a longitudinal study of the relative effectiveness of a three year primary prevention program in boys girls clubs across the nation Tested the effectiveness of a youth drug prevention program in a community setting. Boys & Girls Clubs of America s Stay SMART program, adapted from a school-based personal and social competence drug prevention program, was offered, with and without a 2-year booster program, to 13-year-old members of Boys & Girls Clubs. Over 27 months, (a) 5 Boys & Girls Clubs offered the Stay SMART program, (b) 5 Boys & Girls Clubs offered the Stay SMART program with the booster programs, and (c) 4 Boys & Girls Clubs served as a control group. The Stay SMART program alone and the Stay SMART program with the booster programs showed effects for marijuana-related behavior, cigarette-related behavior, alcohol-related behavior, overall drug-related behavior, and knowledge concerning drug use. The Stay SMART program with the booster programs produced additional effects for alcohol attitudes and marijuana attitudes after each year of booster programs. Results suggest that a school-based personal and social competence program can be adapted effectively to a community setting and that booster programs might enhance program effects.

3,"contribution of income related inequality and healthcare utilisation to survival in cancers of the lung liver stomach and colon Objectives To examine differences in the survival rates of cancer patients according to socioeconomic status, focusing on the role of the degree of healthcare utilisation by the patient. Methods An observational follow-up study was done for 261 lung cancer, 259 liver cancer, 268 stomach cancer and 270 colon cancer patients, diagnosed during 1999–2002. Income status and healthcare utilisation were assessed with National Health Insurance (NHI) data; survival during 1999–2002 was identified by death certificate. HRs and 95% CI were derived from Cox proportional hazards regression. Results and Conclusions The HRs for low income status are larger for colon cancer (2.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.80), followed by stomach (1.67, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.78), liver (1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39) and lung cancers (1.46, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.14). In the model including the variable of healthcare utilisation, colon and stomach cancers exhibited a lower HR in the moderate healthcare utilisation groups (0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.76 in colon; 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.96 in stomach), whereas for liver cancer, the high utilisation group exhibited a higher hazard (1.72, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.75). A lower income status is independently related to a shorter survival time in cancer patients, especially in less fatal cancers. Healthcare utilisation independently affects the likelihood of survival from colon and stomach cancers, implying that a moderate degree of healthcare utilisation contributes to a longer survival time.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4876463711261749, 0.4605579376220703, 0.39541900157928467, 0.38894346356391907, 0.3722214698791504, 0.3808767795562744, 0.5673027634620667, 0.32941585779190063, 0.5348346829414368]"
4,"long term effects of a communication intervention for spanish dominant latinas Background Few studies compare the influence of different types of dietary interventions on the dietary practices of Latinas in the short and long term. The present study examined the 1-year impact of two innovative behavior-change approaches to reduce dietary fat and increase fiber. Design Three-group randomized controlled trial: (1) personalized dietary counseling via lay heath advisors (promotoras) plus tailored print materials delivered via the mail, (2) tailored mailed print materials only, and (3) targeted mailed “off-the-shelf” materials. Setting/Participants A total of 357 Latinas were randomly assigned to the three aforementioned conditions. Intervention Promotora and tailored print materials. Main Outcome Measures Fat intake (total grams of fat and percent calories from dietary fat) and number of grams of dietary fiber. Results Earlier work reported that at immediate post-intervention the promotora group achieved significantly lower levels of total fat grams, and lower levels of energy intake, total saturated fat, total carbohydrates, glucose, and fructose than the targeted group. However, the present longitudinal analyses suggest that the effects achieved by the promotoras dissipated over the 12-month follow-up period while the effects of the tailored group concurrently improved. Conclusions The high interactivity (i.e., calls, visits) of the promotora condition may have been the most salient reinforcer and may have led to further tailoring, making this type of intervention more effective than the comparison groups in the short term. Further research should explore whether booster sessions involving promotoras help to maintain the impact over time.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4389347732067108, 0.44816431403160095, 0.3692798316478729, 0.384823739528656, 0.380782812833786, 0.3948909640312195, 0.5284146666526794, 0.3357114791870117, 0.515246570110321]"
5,"gender trends in radiology authorship a 35 year analysis OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to describe trends over time in female authorship in the radiology literature and to investigate the tendency of female first authors to publish with female senior authors. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on the gender of academic physician authors based in the United States for all major articles published in three general radiology journals—Radiology, AJR, and Academic Radiology—were collected and analyzed for the years 1978, 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2013. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant trends over time, and a chi-square test of independence was performed to determine significant relations between the genders of first and senior authors.

6,"a gender based comparison of promotion and research productivity in academic dermatology Author(s): John, Ann M; Gupta, Arjun B; John, Elizabeth S; Lopez, Santiago A; Lambert, William Clark | Abstract: Purpose: Gender disparities within academic promotion have been reported in several medical specialties. Female representationin association with research productivity has not been reported among academic dermatologists. As research productivity is a heavily weighted factor in determining promotion, we sought to determine whether gender disparities in academic rank and scholarly impact, measured by the h-index, exist in academic dermatology.Methods: In 2015, the authors determined gender and academic rank using academic dermatology department websites. H- index and publication range were determined using the Scopus database. Rank, h-index, and publication range were compared between male and female academic dermatologists.Results: The h-index of academic dermatologists increased with successive academic rank from Assistant Professor through Professor (pl0.001), although no significant difference existed between Chairs and Professors. Publication range also increased with each successive rank from Assistant Professor through Professor (pl0.001), with no statistical significant difference between publication range of Chairs and Professors. Overall, men had higher h-indices than female colleagues (pl0.001). This difference was maintained when controlling for academic rank among Assistant Professors, Professors, and Chairs and when controlling for publication range in years.Conclusion: Women in academic dermatology are underrepresented among senior academic ranks. The difference in scholarly productivity between male and female academic dermatologists may contribute to this disparity. Recommendation for earlyinvolvement in research activities may help minimize this gap.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.48630937933921814, 0.4540097713470459, 0.4487573206424713, 0.36637768149375916, 0.38269510865211487, 0.3446207344532013, 0.5869327187538147, 0.3092283606529236, 0.54442298412323]"
7,"authorship gender and geography in journals published by the royal college of psychiatrists Aims and method: To determine female authorship of original articles and editorials between January 1997 and December 2008 in the British Journal of Psychiatry and the Psychiatric Bulletin. Editorials from Advances in Psychiatric Treatment and the geographical region of the female first author of original articles were also included in the study. Results: The gender was determined for 99.2% of the 2324 first authors of original articles and 100% of the 614 editorials. The percentage of original articles by female first authors fluctuated over the study period, ranging from 22.5 to 42.1% (mean 33.6) in the British Journal of Psychiatry, and from 25.5 to 46.8% (mean 37.6) in the Psychiatric Bulletin. There was a gross underrepresentation of females as first authors of editorials in all three journals. The percentage of female first authors of original articles from low- and middle-income countries ranged from 0.3 to 3.4% in both the British Journal of Psychiatry and the Psychiatric Bulletin.

8,"impact of a structured hiv testing program in a hospital emergency department and a primary care center Introduction HIV testing guidelines are poorly implemented in most clinical settings. The best screening strategy and healthcare scenario are still unknown. The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of a structured HIV testing intervention (DRIVE), compared to HIV testing as routinely performed in clinical practice, in two different clinical settings: a primary care center and an emergency department. Methods Prospective evaluation of an HIV testing strategy in two clinical settings from the same healthcare area. The DRIVE program included trained nurse practitioners to perform the screening, a questionnaire to assess the risk of exposure and HIV indicator conditions (RE&IC), and rapid HIV tests. The main variables between the DRIVE program and clinical practice were the absolute number of newly diagnosed HIV infections and testing coverage. Results The DRIVE program included 5,329 participants, of which 51.2% reported at least one positive answer in the questionnaire. The estimated HIV testing coverage was significantly higher in the DRIVE program than in the routine clinical practice (7.17% vs. 0.96%, p < 0.001), and was better in the primary care center than in the emergency department with the two strategies. Twenty-two HIV-positive people were identified, with a rate of 8.6‰ in the emergency department vs. 2.2‰ in the primary care center (p = 0.001). A higher rate of new HIV diagnoses was found in the DRIVE program compared to routine clinical practice (29.6 vs. 3.1 per 100,000 patients attended; p < 0.001).

Their interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify transitional themes. Findings are discussed in terms of two master themes: changes of identity (involving feelings of gradual invisibility as a valued employee, acquisition of a ‘mother’ identity creating return dilemmas and efforts to revalidate oneself upon re-entry as both a valued employee and a mother); and changed psychological contracts (pertaining to the fulfilment of mutual expectations). Overall, women appeared to struggle subjectively with prevailing their rights, needs and concerns as mothers while simultaneously also maintaining their identity as valued and functional members of the organization.

Intervention students reported significantly more daily vigorous activity than controls (58.6 minutes vs 46.5 minutes; P<.003). Blood pressure, body size, and cholesterol measures did not differ significantly between treatment groups. No evidence of deleterious effects of this intervention on growth or development was observed.

15,"the effectiveness and sustainability of two demand driven sanitation and hygiene approaches in zimbabwe Since 2000 a number of community-driven sanitation approaches have emerged that counter a historical trend to subsidise the provision of latrines to the poor. This study reports on a set of findings and conclusions concerning the effectiveness and sustainability of two such approaches operating in Zimbabwe, the community health club (CHC) approach and community-led total sanitation (CLTS). Surveys, interviews and focus groups were conducted in a total of ten project communities from three districts. Results show that, despite little resistance to the idea, a household’s ability to own a latrine depends heavily on its ability to afford one. Affordability is also key in moving up the ‘sanitation ladder’, which is necessary if behaviour change is to be sustained in the long term. Whilst both approaches effectively encouraged measures that combat open defecation, only health clubs witnessed a significant increase in the adoption of hand washing. However, CLTS proved more effective in promoting latrine construction, suggesting that the emphasis the CHCs place on hygiene practices such as hand washing needs to be coupled with an even stronger focus on the issue of sanitation brought by CLTS.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4951336085796356, 0.45035433769226074, 0.4193679988384247, 0.34872928261756897, 0.37761953473091125, 0.3623791038990021, 0.5756736993789673, 0.3114285469055176, 0.5453220009803772]"
16,"female representation on emergency medicine editorial teams Objective: To analyse the presence of women on the editorial teams of emergency medicine journals and the potential relationship between the pre-eminence of the journal and their presence. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, we examined 10 journals cited under the heading of ‘Emergency Medicine’ by Thomson Scientific in the Journal Citation Reports and 14 additional emergency journals not cited but which publish investigations in emergency medicine. We evaluated the editorial board posted on their websites, determining the number of men and women occupying executive tasks, as well as the sex of the editor-in-chief of each journal. Results: We identified 372 people working on the editorial teams (mean: 15.5, SD: 13.5), 49 being women (13.2%). Of these 372 people, 28 were editors-in-chief but only one was female (3.6%). We found no statistical differences between indexed and nonindexed emergency journals regarding female representation on the editorial team or in the position of editor-in-chief. Neither did we find any relationship between female presence and the pre-eminence of the indexed journals using impact factor as a surrogate marker. Conclusion: Very few women are found either on editorial teams or in editor-in-chief positions in the emergency medicine journals, irrespective of the pre-eminence of the journal. It should be investigated whether a negative journal bias underlies these findings.© 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4500788748264313, 0.4530521631240845, 0.4151208996772766, 0.3677145540714264, 0.37306827306747437, 0.36155587434768677, 0.5436183214187622, 0.33445191383361816, 0.5193119049072266]"
17,"bundled hiv and hepatitis c testing in the emergency department a randomized controlled trial Author(s): Cowan, Ethan; Herman, Heather S.; Rahman, Sara; Zahn, Jennifer; Leider, Jason; Calderon, Yvette | Abstract: Introduction: An estimated 25% of the 1.2 million individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S. are co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends HCV testing for high-risk groups. Our goal was to measure the impact of bundled HIV and HCV testing vs. HIV testing alone on test acceptance and identification of HCV and HIV.Methods: We conducted a two-armed, randomized controlled trial on a convenience sample of 478 adult patients in the Jacobi Medical Center emergency department from December 2012 to May 2013. Participants were randomized to receive either an offer of bundled HIV/HCV testing or HIV testing alone. We compared the primary outcome, HIV test acceptance, between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included HIV and HCV prevalence, and HCV test acceptance, refusal, risk, and knowledge. Results: We found no significant difference in HIV test acceptance between the bundled HCV/HIV (91.8%) and HIV-only (90.6%) groups (p=0.642). There were also no significant differences in test acceptance based on gender, race, or ethnicity. A majority of participants (76.6%) reported at least one HCV risk factor. No participants tested positive for HIV, and one (0.5%) tested positive for HCV. Conclusion: Integrating bundled, rapid HCV/HIV testing into an established HIV testing program did not significantly impact HIV test acceptance. Future screening efforts for HCV could be integrated into current HIV testing models to target high-risk cohorts.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4571768343448639, 0.4536720812320709, 0.436824768781662, 0.3919943869113922, 0.3639245629310608, 0.37645554542541504, 0.5433109998703003, 0.33740654587745667, 0.5283490419387817]"

In order to reach a wider audience, a peer education programme in Bradford gave one-off sessions to groups of older people providing information about falls prevention and demonstrating simple balance and strength building exercises. Although evaluation found the programme to be well received, it also revealed a high rate of undisclosed falls and a reluctance to inform, or seek advice from, health professionals.

19,"promoting physical activity in rural communities walking trail access use and effects Abstract Introduction: Environmental and policy approaches to promote physical activity, such as walking trail construction and promotion, are being widely recommended, yet sparse data exist on their effectiveness. In conjunction with ongoing community-intervention projects in Missouri, walking trails are being built, promoted, and evaluated. Objectives include determining: (1) patterns and correlates of walking, (2) the availability of places to walk and perform other forms of physical activity, (3) the extent of walking trail use and possible effects on rates of physical activity, and (4) attitudes toward the trails and their uses. Methods: In 12 rural counties in Missouri we used a cross-sectional telephone survey to ask a population-based sample of residents aged >18 years ( n = 1269) some standard and specially developed questions about walking behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes. Results: Only 19.5% of respondents were classified as regular walkers. About one third of respondents (36.5%) reported having access to walking trails in their area, and 50.3% reported having access to indoor facilities for exercise. Among persons with access to walking trails, 38.8% had used the trails. Groups who were more likely to have used the walking trails included women, persons with more education, those making $35,000 or more per year, and regular walkers. Among persons who had used the trails, 55.2% reported they had increased their amount of walking since they began using the trail. Women and persons with a high school education or less were more than twice as likely to have increased the amount of walking since they began using the walking trails. Conclusions: Walking trails may be beneficial in promoting physical activity among segments of the population at highest risk for inactivity, in particular women and persons in lower socioeconomic groups.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4764834940433502, 0.46516934037208557, 0.41960033774375916, 0.37768998742103577, 0.37710925936698914, 0.35225337743759155, 0.5594732165336609, 0.3289513885974884, 0.5110613107681274]"

23,"impact of the stand your ground law on gun deaths evidence of a rural urban dichotomy We explore the impact of the Stand Your Ground (SYG) law on gun deaths by degree of urbanization. Unlike firearm homicides the definition of firearm deaths does not depend on the broadening of the self-defense provision that the SYG law represents. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that the SYG law had no impact on gun deaths at the state level. However, once the U.S. states are disaggregated into portions by degree of urbanization—central city, suburb, small urban area and rural area—we find that the law increased gun deaths in the central cities and the suburbs, and had no impact in smaller urban areas and rural areas. These findings are consistent with the fact that there is a great divide between urban and rural areas in terms of ownership and usage of guns, attitudes towards guns, and the implications thereof. The finding of increased violence in the suburbs is of particular interest in the historical backdrop whereby the growth of the suburbs, to a large extent, may have been motivated by a desire to escape crime and violence.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.42716890573501587, 0.42998772859573364, 0.3981606960296631, 0.4148901700973511, 0.37944263219833374, 0.4269986152648926, 0.5209413766860962, 0.3460406959056854, 0.5188744068145752]"

Research design and methods: The study included 4293 children and adolescents (12.9 ± 2.6 yr, diabetes >1 yr) attending AJD (Aide aux Jeunes Diabetiques) summer camps between 2009 and 2014. The distribution of insulin regimens and associations between HbA1c, therapeutic regimens, diabetes knowledge (AJD questionnaire), and Quality of Life (Ingersoll et Marrero, Hvidoere Study Group short version) were assessed. Results: The percentage of youth treated with insulin pumps increased up to about 45%, basal bolus stabilized around 40%, and other regimens decreased majorly. HbA1c was higher with premixed insulins only regimens (9.05 ± 2.43%), but there was no difference between pump (8.12 ± 1.09%), basal bolus (8.32 ± 1.33%) and two to three injections (8.18 ± 1.28%).

Method Randomised controlled trial of 152 public hospital outpatients awaiting hip or knee replacement surgery who were not classified as requiring urgent surgery. Participants were randomised to a self-management program or to usual care. The primary outcome was change in the Health Education Intervention Questionnaire (HeiQ) from randomisation to 6 month follow-up. Quality of life and depressive symptoms were also measured. Changes in pain and function were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Arthritis Index. Results At 6 month follow-up, health-directed behaviour was significantly greater in the intervention [mean 4.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.99–4.58] than the control (mean 3.81, 95% CI 3.52–4.09; P =0.017). There was also a significant effect on skill and technique acquisition for the intervention (mean 4.37, 95% CI 4.19–4.55) in comparison to control (mean 4.11, 95% CI 3.93–4.29; P =0.036). There was no significant effect of the intervention on the remaining HeiQ subscales, WOMAC pain or disability, quality of life or depressive symptoms. Discussion The arthritis self-management program improved health-directed behaviours, skill acquisition and stiffness in patients on a joint replacement waiting list, although the observed effects were of modest size (Cohen s d between 0.36 and 0.42).

27,"management of multiple sclerosis across managed care and fee for service systems Objective: To measure and compare care for adults with MS across managed care and fee-for-service (FFS) health systems. Methods: The authors sampled adults with MS having physician visits over a 2-year period from a group model health maintenance organization (HMO) in southern California, from a midwestern independent practice association (IPA) model managed care plan, and from the FFS portion of the practices of a random sample of southern California neurologists. The authors mailed surveys to subjects in mid-1996; 930 of 1,164 (80%) of those eligible responded. The authors measured sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, management of recent changes in mobility, bladder control, and fatigue, use of a disease-modifying agent, assessment of general health symptoms and issues, and unmet information needs. The authors adjusted comparisons between systems for comorbidity, disease severity, and disease type. Results: The groups differed on most sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. There were few differences in symptom management; differences that did exist tended toward more referrals or treatment for the FFS group. Access to the disease-modifying agent available at the time of the survey did not differ across systems, although patients’ perceptions of the rationale for not using the drug did vary. General health issues and symptoms were more often assessed in the FFS and IPA systems than in the HMO, but improvement was needed across all three systems of care. There were substantial unmet information needs in all groups and especially high ones in the FFS and HMO samples. Conclusions: Strategies to improve care for people with MS should be developed and evaluated, particularly in areas like symptom assessment and meeting patient information needs. Where variations in service delivery exist, longitudinal studies are also needed to evaluate the potential impact on outcomes and to evaluate reasons for variation.","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4642176628112793, 0.47480979561805725, 0.4093051850795746, 0.3827655613422394, 0.3740609884262085, 0.36703383922576904, 0.5397979021072388, 0.33860552310943604, 0.5090879797935486]"
28,"access to health care for people with multiple sclerosis The Sonya Slifka Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Study follows a population-based cohort of approximately 2000 people with MS to study demographic and clinical characteristics, use and cost of health services, provider and treatment characteristics, neurological, economic, and psychosocial outcomes. We examined key indicators of access to health care and found that the majority of participants had health insurance, a usual source of care, and access to specialty care. Nevertheless, 3.8% did not have health insurance which, with application of sampling weights, corresponds to approximately 7000 people with MS in the US population. Even with insurance, population-based estimates indicated that substantial numbers of people with MS have plans that pay nothing toward prescription medication, limit their access to specialists, and restrict their choice of hospitals and providers. Some 9% of the sample, corresponding to 15 800 people with MS, did not have a usual source of MS care; 11.8% or 17 300 people d...","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.43168044090270996, 0.4274042248725891, 0.40083256363868713, 0.4050235152244568, 0.37107548117637634, 0.43431228399276733, 0.514930009841919, 0.34110227227211, 0.5311306715011597]"
29,"prevalence of severe congenital heart disease after folic acid fortification of grain products time trend analysis in quebec canada Objective To investigate whether the 1998 government policy for mandatory fortification of flour and pasta products with folate was followed by a reduction in the prevalence of severe congenital heart defects. Design Time trend analysis. Setting Province of Quebec, Canada. Participants Infants born in 1990-2005 identified with severe congenital heart defects (tetralogy of Fallot, endocardial cushion defects, univentricular hearts, truncus arteriosus, or transposition complexes) in Quebec administrative databases. Methods Data analysed in two time periods (before and after fortification). Birth prevalence measured annually as infants (live and stillbirths) with severe congenital heart defects per 1000 births in Quebec. Changes in the birth prevalence from the period before to the period after fortification were estimated with Poisson regression. Results Among the 1 324 440 births in Quebec in 1990-2005 there were 2083 infants born with severe congenital heart defects, corresponding to an average birth prevalence of 1.57/1000 births. Time trend analysis showed no change in the birth prevalence of severe birth defects in the nine years before fortification (rate ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.03), while in the seven years after fortification there was a significant 6% decrease per year (0.94, 0.90 to 0.97). Conclusions Public health measures to increase folic acid intake were followed by a decrease in the birth prevalence of severe congenital heart defects. These findings support the hypothesis that folic acid has a preventive effect on heart defects.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4650443196296692, 0.48434850573539734, 0.4015999734401703, 0.3925011456012726, 0.37131693959236145, 0.3876999020576477, 0.5684531331062317, 0.3270534873008728, 0.5315899848937988]"

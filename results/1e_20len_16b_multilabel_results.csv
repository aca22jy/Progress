0,"post natal depression psychology science and the transition to motherhood Post-Natal Depression challenges the expectation that it is normal to be a happy mother . It provides a radical critique of the traditional medical and social science explanations of post natal depression by supplying a systematic feminist psychological analysis of women s experiences following childbirth. Paula Nicolson argues that, far from it being an abnormal, undesirable, pathological condition, it is a normal, healthy response to a series of losses. Post Natal Depression makes an important contribution to the psychology of women and feminist research and will be of interst to psychologists, social scientists, nurses and doctors.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.3659530282020569, 0.4294835031032562, 0.3492583930492401, 0.5822820663452148, 0.3640054762363434, 0.2975761294364929, 0.4624696671962738, 0.36591312289237976, 0.37221068143844604]"
1,"the long term prevention of tobacco use among junior high school students classroom and telephone interventions OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a long-term tobacco use prevention program for junior high school students that used college undergraduate change agents and telephone boosters. METHODS. A psychosocial intervention combining refusal skills training, contingency management, and other tobacco use prevention methodologies such as telephone and mail boosters was implemented in 11 junior high schools in San Diego County, California. Eleven other junior high schools served as controls. Of the 2668 participants, 57% were White/non-Hispanic, 24% were Hispanic, and 19% were of other racial/ethnic groups. College undergraduates served as change agents for both the classroom and booster interventions, the latter of which was delivered in the third (ninth-grade) year of the program. RESULTS.

3,"extruded rice fortified with micronized ground ferric pyrophosphate reduces iron deficiency in indian schoolchildren a double blind randomized controlled trial Background: Iron fortification of rice could be an effective strategy for reducing iron deficiency anemia in South Asia. Objective: We aimed to determine whether extruded rice grains fortified with micronized ground ferric pyrophosphate (MGFP) would increase body iron stores in children. Design: In a double-blind, 7-mo, school-based feeding trial in Bangalore, India, iron-depleted, 6-13-y-old children (n = 184) were randomly assigned to receive either a rice-based lunch meal fortified with 20 mg Fe as MGFP or an identical but unfortified control meal. The meals were consumed under direct supervision, and daily leftovers were weighed. All children were dewormed at baseline and at 3.5 mo. Iron status and hemoglobin were measured at baseline, 3.5 mo, and 7 mo. Results: At baseline, the prevalences of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in the total sample were 78% and 29%, respectively. After 7 mo of feeding, there was a significant increase in body iron stores in both study groups (P < 0.001), with a greater increase in the iron group than in the control group (P < 0.05). There was a significant time X treatment interaction for iron deficiency, which fell from 78% to 25% in the dewormed iron group and from 79% to 49% in the dewormed control group. Iron deficiency anemia decreased from 30% to 15% (NS) in the iron group but remained virtually unchanged in the control group (28% and 27%). In sensory tests, the MGFP-fortified rice (fortified at 3 and 5 mg Fe/100 g) was indistinguishable from natural rice, in both cooked and uncooked form. Conclusions: Extruded rice fortified with MGFP has excellent sensory characteristics. Fed in a school lunch meal, it increases iron stores and reduces the prevalence of iron deficiency in Indian children.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.4045550227165222, 0.4394068121910095, 0.3713148236274719, 0.5604588985443115, 0.40338853001594543, 0.4023022949695587, 0.4090934991836548, 0.3300056755542755, 0.43547797203063965]"

5,"glycaemic variability in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion csii or multiple daily injections mdi a cross sectional cohort study Summary Objective This cross-sectional observational cohort study was designed to investigate i) whether glycaemic variability in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes is lower in those using an insulin pump (CSII) compared with those using multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) and ii) whether urinary F2-isoprostanes and/or urinary prostaglandin F2 excretion as surrogate marker of oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase activity are associated with glycaemic variability. Methods 48 paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (22 using an insulin pump) underwent an ambulatory 3-day continuous glucose monitoring. All patients continued with normal daily activities and collected urine for two consecutive 24 h periods. The glucose pentagon was used to calculate the glycaemic risk parameter. Results Insulin requirements, HDL-cholesterol, the mean of glycaemic excursions (P < 001) and the standard deviation of mean glucose concentration (P < 005) were significantly lower in patients with CSII compared with those using MDI. By contrast, averaged HbA1c during the last twelve months as well as at the time of sensor insertion did not differ significantly between both groups. Summarizing characteristic parameter of acute and long-term metabolic control into the glucose pentagon revealed a significantly lower glycaemic risk parameter in CSI patients compared with both, healthy subjects and patients using MDI (P < 005). Conclusions Paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump presented with lower glycaemic variability and a concomitantly lower glycaemic risk parameter compared with those using MDII. Whether these findings translate into a lower risk of diabetes associated cardiovascular complications remains to be elucidated.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.3845082223415375, 0.4218006134033203, 0.3440553843975067, 0.5686688423156738, 0.3497975468635559, 0.37966981530189514, 0.39722511172294617, 0.3192550539970398, 0.4325013756752014]"
6,"effectiveness of community directed diabetes prevention and control in a rural aboriginal population in british columbia canada This report presents the process and summative evaluation results from a community-based diabetes prevention and control project implemented in response to the increasing prevalence and impact of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in the Canadian Aboriginal population. The 24-month project targeted the registered Indian population in British Columbia s rural Okanagan region. A participatory approach was used to plan strategies by which diabetes could be addressed in ways acceptable and meaningful to the intervention community. The strategies emphasised a combination of changing behaviours and changing environments. The project was quasi-experimental. A single intervention community was matched to two comparison communities. Workers in the intervention community conducted interviews of individuals with or at risk for diabetes during a seven-month pre-intervention phase (n = 59). Qualitative analyses were conducted to yield strategies for intervention. Implementation began in the eighth month of the project. Trend measurements of diabetes risk factors were obtained for high-risk cohorts (persons with or at familial risk for NIDDM) (n = 105). Cohorts were tracked over a 16-month intervention phase, with measurements at baseline, the midpoint and completion of the study. Cross-sectional population surveys of diabetes risk factors were conducted at baseline and the end of the intervention phase (n = 295). Surveys of community systems were conducted three times. The project yielded few changes in quantifiable outcomes. Activation of the intervention community was insufficient to enable individual and collective change through dissemination of quality interventions for diabetes prevention and control. Theory and previous research were not sufficiently integrated with information from pre-intervention interviews. Interacting with these limitations were the short planning and intervention phases, just 8 and 16 months, respectively. The level of penetration of the interventions mounted was too limited to be effective. Attention to process is warranted and to the feasibility of achieving effects within 24 months.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.35902753472328186, 0.42938047647476196, 0.33422836661338806, 0.5521848797798157, 0.3646910488605499, 0.31788375973701477, 0.4275050163269043, 0.3483543395996094, 0.3898971378803253]"

Recently, several investigators reported unsuccessful attempts to implement peer education programmes for men who have sex with men in the United Kingdom and raised questions about whether peer-based programmes are effective or feasible. However, POL is a theory-based and very specialized intervention, and the UK peer education programmes did not incorporate many of POL s core or essential elements.

A multiple regression test was used to analyze the relative importance of psychologic factors and other variables in explaining the degree of patients satisfaction with surgery. Postoperative satisfaction was high and increased with time. Patients with more education and more severe deformities reported greater satisfaction. During the early stage after surgery, patients with a high degree of interpersonal sensitivity, whose close relatives did not support surgery, or who accepted surgery passively tended to be more dissatisfied. Patients who had realistic expectations were more satisfied in the long term. Complications such as pain and swelling influenced patients satisfaction soon after surgery, whereas the responses of people around the patients influenced their satisfaction at all stages postoperatively.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.378706693649292, 0.42882344126701355, 0.33833611011505127, 0.5338869690895081, 0.35809066891670227, 0.3531021475791931, 0.42430928349494934, 0.3331684470176697, 0.4148213267326355]"

PCG/Ts are dominated by health professionals, but are responsible for representing the interests of the local community. This paper assesses how they have informed and consulted local communities and the perceived impact of this consultation on decision-making. The paper uses evidence from the National Tracker Survey of PCG/Ts, a longitudinal survey of 72 (15%) of the PCG/Ts in England, using data from telephone interviews with chairs and chief officers, and postal questionnaires to lay board members and representatives of Community Health Councils (CHCs). Eighty-one per cent of PCG/Ts had public involvement working groups. Methods of consulting the community included consulting CHCs (87%), holding public meetings (75%) and consulting local patient groups (67%). Only 31% of chairs felt they were effective at consulting. Ninety-two per cent of CHC representatives attended all board meetings. Most CHC representatives reported that there had been little or no consultation with the CHC in areas such as commissioning, service development or clinical governance. Only 14% of CHC representatives rated PCG/T consultation with the public as effective. Eighty-seven per cent said that local communities were largely unaware of the existence of PCG/Ts, and 70% commented on the weaknesses in PCG/T efforts at public consultation. Public participation is being taken seriously by PCG/Ts, but most are struggling to develop effective ways of involving local communities. Efforts to involve the public may become little more than token gestures. The proposed abolition of CHCs may make it more difficult for PCG/Ts to obtain a lay perspective. Effective consultation requires the development of new methods and adequate resources, but a stronger lay voice in the governance structures of PCG/Ts is needed.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.3427663743495941, 0.43977251648902893, 0.35663285851478577, 0.5564882755279541, 0.3851942718029022, 0.29019108414649963, 0.4392804205417633, 0.35618993639945984, 0.38454702496528625]"
14,"mentoring as a drug prevention strategy an evaluation of across ages This article presents results of a three-year evaluation of Across Ages, an intergenerational approach to drug and alcohol prevention. The program consists of three major elements: 1) a mentoring program in which youths are matched with older adults who provide ongoing support and encouragement in weekly interactions; 2) community service activities designed to promote involvement with and better understanding of the frail elderly; and 3) a school-based like skills curriculum. Approximately 400 6th grade students in Springfield, Massachusetts, an ethnically diverse community with a large proportion of public school students living in low income families, took part in the evaluation over a three year period. Students classes were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: the mentor condition, in which students received the life skills curriculum, communitiy service activities, and were assigned an elderly mentor; the curriculum condition, in which students received only the life skills curriculum and community service activities; and the control condition, in which students received no intervention. Youths involved in the study completed questionnaires on three occasions: prior to the initiation of program activities, at the conclusion of the program, and again six months following the cessation of the program activities. Results indicate that mentoring is associated with significantly lower levels of problem behavior and substance abuse and significantly higher levels of self-confidence, self-control, cooperation, and attachment to both the school and the family. Moreover, students receiving mentoring report significantly lower levels of alcohol use. In contrast, few positive effects of the life skills curriculum or community service activities are observed.

15,"do basic psychological needs moderate relationships within the theory of planned behavior The effects of basic psychological need satisfaction from the self-determination theory on relationships within the theory of planned behavior (TPB) were examined in a prospective study. It was hypothesized that need satisfaction would moderate the relationship between intention and behavior and between intention and its proximal determinants. Participants (n = 250) completed measures of the TPB and psychological need satisfaction with respect to restrictive dietary behaviors. Moderated multiple regression analyses indicated that each psychological need moderated the effects of subjective norms on intention. Results suggest that individuals with high psychological need satisfaction tend to base their intentions on subjective norms to a greater extent compared with individuals with lower psychological need satisfaction. Epidemiological research suggests that rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity in industrialized nations are rising sharply and reaching epidemic proportions (World Health Organization, 1999). As a consequence, there is greater impetus to further understand the psychological antecedents and mechanisms underpinning the self-regulation of dieting behavior.

This paper describes participatory action research (PAR) methods we used to develop, implement and evaluate the Living Well with a Disability program. Community-based agencies that provide information and referral services to people with disabilities (independent living centers funded under Title VII, Rehabilitation Act) recruited a convenience sample of 246 people with mobility impairments to participate in a randomly assigned, wait-list control health promotion intervention study. Paper-and-pencil outcome measures included the secondary conditions surveillance instrument, unhealthy days and health care utilization. Logistic regression on outcomes controlling for demographic variables and pre-test measures indicated reductions in all three outcome variables. People with mobility impairments who participated in the Living Well with a Disability program reported less limitation from secondary conditions, fewer unhealthy days and less health care utilization.

Although childrearing responsibilities are shared by men and women in the modern era, differences in time allocated to child care by sex and its potential impact on residency experience merit discussion. Methods and Materials An anonymous, voluntary, 102-item survey was distributed to 540 current radiation oncology residents and 2014 graduates that asked about marital and parental status, pregnancy during residency, publication productivity, career aspirations, and experiences working with pregnant co-residents. Respondents with children were asked about childcare arrangements, and women who were pregnant during residency were asked about radiation safety, maternity leave, and breastfeeding experiences. Results A total of 190 respondents completed the survey, 107 men (56.3%) and 84 women (43.7%). Ninety-seven respondents (51.1%) were parents, and 84 (44.2%) reported a pregnancy during residency. Respondents with children more often were male (65% vs 47.3%; P =.014), in a higher level of training (79.3% vs 54.8% were PGY4 or higher; P =.001), were older (median age of 32, interquartile range [IQR]:31-35] vs age 30 [IQR: 29-33]; P P =.033), were married (99% vs 43%, respectively; P P P Conclusions Pregnancy and parenthood are common during residency.

22,"humanistic and economic outcomes of pharmacist provided medication review in the community dwelling elderly a systematic review and meta analysis SummaryWhat is known and objective Recent reviews have shown that pharmacist-provided medication review in the elderly can improve clinical outcomes and reduce medication discrepancies compared with usual care. However, none determined whether these translate to improved humanistic and economic outcomes. This review sought to evaluate the effects of medication review on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and healthcare costs in the elderly. Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane library for studies published in English from inception to 31 August 2015 was conducted. The review included studies lasting at least 3 months that randomly assigned community-dwelling participants aged at least 65 years to receive either pharmacist-provided medication review or usual care. Studies set in nursing homes were excluded. Results and discussion The review identified 25 studies that included 15 341 participants and lasted between 3 and 36 months. Twenty and 13 studies reported HRQoL and economic outcomes, respectively. Overall, there was no significant difference in HRQoL and healthcare costs between pharmacist-provided medication review and usual care. Meta-analysis of studies that reported the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey found significant differences in favour of usual care in the body pain (mean difference: 2·94, 95% CI: 0·54–5·34, P = 0·02) and general health perception (mean difference: 1·83, 95% CI: 0·16–3·50, P = 0·03) domains, whereas there were no significant differences in other domains. Meta-analysis of the EuroQol-5D utility (mean difference: −0·01, 95% CI: −0·02–0·01, P = 0·57) and visual analogue scale (mean difference: 0·01, 95% CI: −3·24–3·26, P = 1·00) found no significant differences. Costs of hospitalization, medication and other healthcare resources consumed were similar between groups. What is new and conclusion Humanistic and economic outcomes of pharmacist-provided medication review were largely similar to those of usual care. Further research using more robust methodology is needed to determine whether improved medication management can improve HRQoL and reduce healthcare costs. Careful thought should be given to capturing relevant outcomes that reflect the potential benefits of this intervention.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.3700147271156311, 0.4431971609592438, 0.34638044238090515, 0.5539379715919495, 0.3460119366645813, 0.34023717045783997, 0.4237992763519287, 0.33323055505752563, 0.4046153426170349]"

28,"etiology and prevention of substance use among asian american youth Among populations identified by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, it is anticipated that the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) population will experience the greatest change between 1990 and 2050 (U.S. Bureau of the Census. [1996, February]. Current population reports. Series P25-1130. Washington, DC: U.S. Government printing office). Limited studies focus on APIs as a racial group and still fewer disaggregate samples to specific ethnic Asian subgroupings. This paper begins with definitions of the API communities, then examines rates of adolescent drug use, risk and protective factors, and preventive intervention effectiveness focused on API communities. The limited epidemiological data suggest that in general, APIs are at a relatively lower risk for drug use than youth from most other ethnic groups. However, the available data also suggest that use may not be as low as generally assumed with rates for alcohol use, smoking, and some illicit drugs being equal to or exceeding those of African Americans and European Americans. Despite the paucity of available data on particular Asian subgroups, the available data demonstrate that there are differences among API subgroups, underscoring the importance of identifying Asian subgroups when studying substance use and when planning prevention and treatment. The limited data examining the etiology of drug use across API subgroups suggests that some of the risk and protective factors derived from majority based research may also be predictors for these populations. These data support the utility of examining the generalizability of existing tested prevention approaches among different API communities. Finally, further efforts should be made to encourage and support the evaluation of community-based programs that already target and deliver services to API youth.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.41261807084083557, 0.48107004165649414, 0.3890278935432434, 0.5685098171234131, 0.3569152355194092, 0.40392881631851196, 0.4089893400669098, 0.34591010212898254, 0.4396943151950836]"

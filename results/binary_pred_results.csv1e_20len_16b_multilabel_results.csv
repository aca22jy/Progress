0,"impact of micronutrient fortification of yoghurt on micronutrient status markers and growth a randomized double blind controlled trial among school children in bangladesh Interventions providing foods fortified with multiple micronutrients can be a cost-effective and sustainable strategy to improve micronutrient status and physical growth of school children. We evaluated the effect of micronutrient-fortified yoghurt on the biochemical status of important micronutrients (iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin A) as well as growth indicators among school children in Bogra district of Bangladesh. In a double-masked randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 4 primary schools, 1010 children from classes 1–4 (age 6–9 years) were randomly allocated to receive either micronutrient fortified yoghurt (FY, n = 501) or non-fortified yoghurt (NFY, n = 509). For one year, children were fed with 60 g yoghurt everyday providing 30% RDA for iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A. Anthropometric measurements and blood/urine samples were collected at base-, mid- and end-line. All children (FY, n = 278, NFY, n = 293) consenting for the end-line blood sample were included in the present analyses. Both groups were comparable at baseline for socio-economic status variables, micronutrient status markers and anthropometry measures. Compliance was similar in both the groups. At baseline 53.4% of the population was anemic; 2.1% was iron deficient (ferritin 8.3 mg/L). Children in the FY group showed improvement in Hb (mean difference: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.4-2.5; p = 0.006) as compared to NFY group. Retinol binding protein (mean diff: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.002-0.09; p = 0.04) and iodine levels (mean difference: 39.87; 95% CI: 20.39-59.35; p < 0.001) decreased between base and end-line but the decrease was significantly less in the FY group. Compared to NFY, the FY group had better height gain velocity (mean diff: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.05-0.60; p = 0.02) and height-for-age z-scores (mean diff: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02-0.33; p = 0.03). There was no difference in weight gain velocity, weight-for-age z-scores or Body Mass Index z-scores. In the absence of iron deficiency at baseline the impact on iron status would not be expected to be observed and hence cannot be evaluated. Improved Hb concentrations in the absence of a change in iron status suggest improved utilization of iron possibly due to vitamin A and zinc availability. Fortification improved height gain without affecting weight gain.

1,"community partnership for health and well being the falmouth beacon project The Beacon Project is an example of a successful multi‐agency intervention in a community fraught with social and economic problems. This article first summarises what happened, and then, from the perspectives of organisational and complexity theory, analyses retrospectively the key lessons learnt. The project, which has received national and international recognition, focused upon a partnership between health visitors, residents and statutory agencies. Health visitors helped to forge relationships based on trust and respect, creating the receptive context for transformational change. It is possible that the fluid, ‘collateral’ organisation that was thus developed was capable of both understanding and tackling the complex inter‐organisational and social issues presented by the Estate.The main conclusions are that cohesion and improvement can be developed through facilitated dialogue rather than control and explicit leadership, and that shared vision among agencies, and the trust achieved through equal dialogue, can bring significant change and empowerment to communities.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4430411159992218, 0.48928719758987427, 0.5103798508644104, 0.5306712985038757, 0.31132444739341736, 0.5369182229042053, 0.4262404143810272, 0.44563403725624084, 0.599255383014679]"
2,"being a good mother managing breastfeeding and merging identities Breastfeeding is not simply a technical or practical task but is part of the transition to motherhood, the relationship between mother and baby and the everyday experience of living with a new baby. Discussion of breastfeeding must therefore include the individual s personal and social context. This paper explores how women in England who have chosen to breastfeed their baby accomplish this task during the early stages of motherhood and the relative weight attached to different factors, which impinge on decision-making. Our findings, based on observing 158 interactions between breastfeeding women and midwives or health visitors from one Primary Care Trust in the north of England, UK, and in-depth interviews with a sample of 22 of these women, illustrate the dynamic between breastfeeding, becoming and being a ‘good mother’ and merging multiple identities as they embrace motherhood. In this context, the value attached to breastfeeding as synonymous with being a ‘good mother’ is questioned. In managing the balance between ensuring a healthy, contented baby and the reality of their daily lives, women negotiate the moral minefield that defines ‘good mothering’ and the diverse conceptions and influences that shape it—including health professionals, their social networks and the wider social and structural context of their lives. The implications for policy and practice are discussed.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4569441080093384, 0.4718914330005646, 0.5533958673477173, 0.5362764000892639, 0.31531473994255066, 0.4801180958747864, 0.468389630317688, 0.4381309747695923, 0.62787264585495]"

4,"lessons for increasing awareness and use of booster seats in a latino community Objectives: Latino children are more likely to be unrestrained passengers in motor vehicles than non-Latino children, but little is known about the use of booster seats in Latino families. This study investigates Latino parents’ knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about booster seats, barriers to booster seat use, and effective strategies for message delivery in the Latino community. Methods: Two focus groups were conducted with Spanish speaking parents. Information was obtained through a written survey and moderated discussions. Results: Parents were widely misinformed about recommended guidelines for booster seat use, and the majority of participants did not own a booster seat. Parents identified a lack of information, the cost of booster seats, resistance to use by the child or the father, limited space in the vehicle, and unavailability of shoulder belts as barriers to booster seat use. Participants felt that learning more about the new Washington state booster seat law and its consequences would increase booster seat use. Public health messages felt to be effective were those in Spanish, delivered by credible spokespeople such as physicians and teachers, and utilizing the Spanish media. Conclusions: Campaigns to promote booster seats in the Latino community should be culturally specific, and clear guidelines for booster seat use should be given in Spanish. Legislation may be an important incentive for using booster seats, though reducing their cost and providing strategies to address child resistance and physical constraints of some vehicles are also important.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.46129047870635986, 0.5457332134246826, 0.4516182243824005, 0.558293342590332, 0.35520225763320923, 0.5213142037391663, 0.38836580514907837, 0.3553251326084137, 0.48595142364501953]"

7,"exclusion of elderly women from published randomized trials of stress incontinence surgery Objective More than 20,000 women, aged 70 years or older, undergo surgery for stress urinary incontinence each year. Our objective was to review the published randomized trials of the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence and estimate the proportion of women 70 years or older enrolled in those trials. Data sources MEDLINE and Cochrane Databases of Clinical Trials were searched from January 1966 through December 2003 with the terms urinary incontinence, stress incontinence, urethropexy, needle suspension, pubovaginal sling, tension-free vaginal tape, urethral injection, collagen injection, anterior colporrhaphy, and clinical trial, controlled trial, or randomized trial as both subject headings and words contained in article titles. We supplemented this search with manual searches of meta-analyses and review articles from 2000 to 2003. Methods of study selection All studies that included at least one group undergoing an invasive treatment for stress incontinence (including urethral bulking injections) were reviewed. We excluded reports without sufficient data to estimate the number of women aged 70 and older who participated, those published only in abstract form, and those studies in languages other than English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish. Twenty studies met our inclusion criteria. Tabulation, integration, and results The number of women aged 70 or older in each study was estimated using the demographic data provided. The median percentage of subjects aged 70 or older was 3.8% (interquartile range 0.37-15%). There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects 70 years of age or older based on the year of publication.

8,"evaluating testing strategies for identifying youths with hiv infection and linking youths to biomedical and other prevention services Importance Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected youths are unaware of their serostatus (approximately 60%) and therefore not linked to HIV medical or prevention services. The need to identify promising and scalable approaches to promote uptake of HIV testing among youths at risk is critical. Objective To evaluate a multisite HIV testing program designed to encourage localized HIV testing programs focused on self-identified sexual minority males and to link youths to appropriate prevention services after receipt of their test results. Design, Setting, and Participants Testing strategies were evaluated using an observational design during a 9-month period (June 1, 2015, through February 28, 2016). Testing strategies were implemented by 12 adolescent medicine HIV primary care programs and included targeted testing, universal testing, or a combination. Data were collected from local youth at high risk of HIV infection and, specifically, sexual minority males of color. Main Outcomes and Measures Proportion of sexual minority males and sexual minority males of color tested, proportion of previously undiagnosed HIV-positive youths identified, and rates of linkage to prevention services. Results A total of 3301 youths underwent HIV testing. Overall, 35 (3.6%) of those who underwent universal testing in primary care clinical settings, such as emergency departments and community health centers, were sexual minority males (35 [3.6%] were males of color) compared with 236 (46.7%) (201 [39.8%] were males of color) who were tested through targeted testing and 693 (37.8%) (503 [27.4%] were males of color) through combination efforts. Identification of new HIV-positive cases varied by strategy: 1 (0.1%) via universal testing, 39 (2.1%) through combination testing, and 16 (3.2%) through targeted testing. However, when targeted tests were separated from universal testing results for sites using a combined strategy, the rate of newly identified HIV-positive cases identified through universal testing decreased to 1 (0.1%). Rates of new HIV-positive cases identified through targeted testing increased to 49 (6.3%). Youths who tested through targeted testing (416 [85.1%]) were more likely to link successfully to local HIV prevention services, including preexposure prophylaxis, compared with those who underwent universal testing (328 [34.1%]). Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that community-based targeted approaches to HIV testing are more effective than universal screening for reaching young sexual minority males (especially males of color), identifying previously undiagnosed HIV-positive youths, and linking HIV-negative youths to relevant prevention services. Targeted, community-based HIV testing strategies hold promise as a scalable and effective means to identify high-risk youths who are unaware of their HIV status.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4604611098766327, 0.48532888293266296, 0.5201966166496277, 0.5484148859977722, 0.2816682755947113, 0.48914799094200134, 0.49797382950782776, 0.44346651434898376, 0.6081781983375549]"

11,"interventions to optimise prescribing in care homes systematic review Background: prescribing for older people is a complex process and can elevate the risk of inappropriate prescribing, with potentially severe consequences. With a growing ageing population, strategies to improve prescribing in care homes are essential. Our aim was to review systematically the effects of interventions to optimise prescribing in care homes. Method: databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and the Cochrane Library from 1990. Search terms included were ‘nursing home’, ‘residential home’, ‘inappropriate prescribing’, ‘education’ and ‘intervention’. Two independent reviewers undertook screening and methodological quality assessment, using the Downs and Black rating scale. Results: the search strategy retrieved 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Four intervention strategies were identified: staff education, multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings, pharmacist medication reviews and computerised clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). Complex educational programmes that focused on improving patients’ behavioural management and drug prescribing were the most studied area, with six of eight studies highlighting an improvement in prescribing. Mixed results were found for pharmacist interventions. CDSSs were evaluated in two studies, with one showing a significant improvement in appropriate drug orders. Two of three studies examining MDT meetings found an overall improvement in appropriate prescribing. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in the outcome measures. Conclusion: results are mixed and there is no one interventional strategy that has proved to be effective. Nevertheless, education including academic detailing seems to show most promise. A multi-faceted approach and clearer policy guidelines are likely to be required to improve prescribing for these vulnerable patients.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.469196617603302, 0.5682478547096252, 0.45797744393348694, 0.5672640204429626, 0.33127376437187195, 0.5114283561706543, 0.4107460677623749, 0.35389673709869385, 0.48647767305374146]"

The social relations generated are seen to be shaped by organizational factors that are constitutive of the walks; the resulting culture having implications for the sustainability of the experience. As there appears to be no single uniting theory linking group walk experiences to the production of social relations at this time, the findings are considered against therapeutic landscape, therapeutic mobility, and social capital theorizing.

13,"contribution of community based newborn health promotion to reducing inequities in healthy newborn care practices and knowledge evidence of improvement from a three district pilot program in malawi Inequities in both health status and coverage of health services are considered important barriers to achieving Millennium Development Goal 4. Community-based health promotion is a strategy that is believed to reduce inequities in rural low-income settings. This paper examines the contributions of community-based programming to improving the equity of newborn health in three districts in Malawi. This study is a before-and-after evaluation of Malawi’s Community-Based Maternal and Newborn Care (CBMNC) program, a package of facility and community-based interventions to improve newborn health. Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) within the catchment area of 14 health facilities were trained to make pregnancy and postnatal home visits to promote healthy behaviors and assess women and newborns for danger signs requiring referral to a facility. “Core groups” of community volunteers were also trained to raise awareness about recommended newborn care practices. Baseline and endline household surveys measured the coverage of the intervention and targeted health behaviors for this before-and-after evaluation. Wealth indices were constructed using household asset data and concentration indices were compared between baseline and endline for each indicator. The HSAs trained in the intervention reached 36.7% of women with a pregnancy home visit and 10.9% of women with a postnatal home visit within three days of delivery. Coverage of the intervention was slightly inequitable, with richer households more likely to receive one or two pregnancy home visits (concentration indices (CI) of 0.0786 and 0.0960), but not significantly more likely to receive a postnatal visit or know of a core group. Despite modest coverage levels for the intervention, health equity improved significantly over the study period for several indicators. Greater improvements in inequities were observed for knowledge indicators than for coverage of routine health services. At endline, a greater proportion of women from the poorest quintile knew three or more danger signs for pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum mothers than did women from the least poor quintile (change in CI: -0.1704, -0.2464, and -0.4166, respectively; p < 0.05). Equity also significantly improved for coverage of some health behaviors, including delivery at a health facility (change in CI: -0.0591), breastfeeding within the first hour (-0.0379), and delayed bathing (-0.0405). Although these results indicate promising improvements for newborn health in Malawi, the extent to which the CBMNC program contributed to these improvements in coverage and equity are not known. The strategies through which community-based programs are implemented likely play an important role in their ability to improve equity, and further research and program monitoring are needed to ensure that the poorest households are reached by community-based health programs.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4509723484516144, 0.47535765171051025, 0.5162891745567322, 0.5426810383796692, 0.3049512505531311, 0.5303229689598083, 0.47393351793289185, 0.45054906606674194, 0.6202864050865173]"
14,"survival disparities in non small cell lung cancer by race ethnicity and socioeconomic status PURPOSE Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is among the leading causes of cancer death in the United States. Previous studies found mixed results regarding disparities in survival by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). However, race comparisons were usually limited, with comparisons made between black and white patients only or by merging race and ethnicity together as non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic patients. Even fewer studies included race, ethnicity, and SES together while controlling for extensive confounding variables. Thus, because we have access to a large and unique population-based database that includes tumor characteristics and patient comorbidities, the purpose of this study was to explore disparities in NSCLC survival. METHODS We linked data from the 1996 to 2007 Florida Cancer Data System registry to the Florida s Agency for Health Care Administration and the US Census (n = 98,541). Survival time was from date of diagnosis to death or last contact. Race was white, black, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Asian Indian/Pakistani, or other. Ethnicity was non-Hispanic or Hispanic. Socioeconomic status was measured as percentage of the participant s census tract living below the federal poverty line. Median survival and survival rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression models produced unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS The majority of patients were white (91.9%) and non-Hispanic (94.1%). Blacks had the lowest median survival (8.4 months). At 5 years after diagnosis, survival rate was highest in whites (16.3%) and lowest for Pacific Islanders (6.4%). In the adjusted model, Asians had significantly improved survival compared with whites (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.95). Patients in middle-low (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99), middle-high (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94), and highest (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.91) SES areas had significantly improved survival compared with those in lowest areas. Significantly worse survival was found for patients with complicated diabetes (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08), weight loss (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11), fluid and electrolyte disorders (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11), and alcohol abuse (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.14). DISCUSSION We found strong evidence for racial and socioeconomic disparities in Floridian NSCLC survival. Asians had improved survival compared with whites, a novel finding. Our findings confirmed that patients living in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods have worse outcomes than their wealthier neighborhood counterparts. Finally, we found an association between some modifiable factors/comorbidities and worse survival. Clinicians may be able to use this information to improve patients likelihood of better outcomes.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.43702301383018494, 0.4768064320087433, 0.5218647718429565, 0.5591462254524231, 0.29721787571907043, 0.5052347183227539, 0.47757187485694885, 0.43472155928611755, 0.6164601445198059]"

Design Limited prospective study. Setting A regional infertility clinic and antenatal clinic. Patient(s) Seventy women who had conceived through assisted reproductive technology and 111 women who had conceived naturally. Intervention(s) Measures of self-esteem, anxiety, and parenting self-efficacy. Main Outcome Measure(s) Self-esteem, anxiety, and parenting self-efficacy. Result(s) Women who had conceived through IVF treatment did not differ in terms of self-esteem during pregnancy from those who had conceived naturally. All of the women in the present study displayed levels of self-esteem that were within the normal range. Self-esteem increased as pregnancy progressed. Self-esteem was negatively correlated with anxiety during pregnancy. As self-esteem increased, anxiety decreased. Self-esteem at the start of pregnancy (18 weeks) and anxiety in the early stages of parenthood (6 weeks postpartum) predicted parenting self-efficacy. Conclusion(s) Self-esteem in the early stages of pregnancy, for both women who conceived through IVF and women who conceived naturally, is related to self-reported levels of parenting efficacy.

19,"church based breast cancer screening education impact of two approaches on latinas enrolled in public and private health insurance plans Introduction The Tepeyac Project is a church-based health promotion project that was conducted from 1999 through 2005 to increase breast cancer screening rates among Latinas in Colorado. Previous reports evaluated the project among Medicare and Medicaid enrollees in the state. In this report, we evaluate the program among enrollees in the state s five major insurance plans. Methods We compared the Tepeyac Project s two interventions: the Printed Intervention and the Promotora Intervention. In the first, we mailed culturally tailored education packages to 209 Colorado Catholic churches for their use. In the second, promotoras (peer counselors) in four Catholic churches delivered breast-health education messages personally. We compared biennial mammogram claims from the five insurance plans in the analysis at baseline (1998–1999) and during follow-up (2000–2001) for Latinas who had received the interventions. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis to adjust rates for confounders. Results The mammogram rate for Latinas in the Printed Intervention remained the same from baseline to follow-up (58% [2979/5130] vs 58% [3338/5708]). In the Promotora Intervention, the rate was 59% (316/536) at baseline and 61% (359/590) at follow-up. Rates increased modestly over time and varied widely by insurance type. After adjusting for age, income, urban versus rural location, disability, and insurance type, we found that women exposed to the Promotora Intervention had a significantly higher increase in biennial mammograms than did women exposed to the Printed Intervention (GEE parameter estimate = .24 [±.11], P = .03). Conclusion For insured Latinas, personally delivering church-based education through peer counselors appears to be a better breast-health promotion method than mailing printed educational materials to churches.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4528496563434601, 0.528983473777771, 0.49880266189575195, 0.5438247323036194, 0.32592520117759705, 0.5052246451377869, 0.43749091029167175, 0.4132685959339142, 0.5472111701965332]"

Design Secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial. Setting Home-based rehabilitation; measurements in university laboratory. Participants Community-dwelling people (N=81) aged ≥60 years recovering from a hip fracture. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (n=40) or a control (n=41) group, on average, 42±23 days after discharge from the hospital. Intervention A yearlong intervention included evaluation and modification of environmental hazards, guidance for safe walking, nonpharmacologic pain management, a progressive home exercise program, PA counseling, and standard care. Main Outcome Measures The outcome was the level of PA, which was assessed with the questionnaire (a modified Grimby scale) at baseline, and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after baseline. Three PA categories were defined: inactivity, light PA, and moderate to heavy PA. Physical function was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at baseline. The effects of the intervention were analyzed with generalized estimating equations. Results In the intervention group, a significant increase was observed in the level of PA after the intervention (interaction P =.005) and after 1-year follow-up ( P =.021) compared with the standard care only.

Patients and methods The study was a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with general practice the unit of randomization. Six West Midlands general practices with a high proportion of South Asian patients were randomized to enhanced care using Asian link workers and extra community diabetes specialist nurse sessions (intervention) or continued standard practice care (control). Results Of 401 patients recruited to the study, 361 (90%), comprising 178 from Coventry and 183 from Birmingham were eligible and included in the analyses. The mean age at baseline (standard deviation, SD) was 58.9 (11.7 years) with median (interquartile range; IQR) duration of diabetes 6.5 (3-11) years. At one year follow-up there was a significant difference in reduction of systolic (4.6 mmHg, P=0.035) and diastolic blood pressure (3.4 mmHg, P=0.003) and total cholesterol (0.4 mmol/l, P=0.005), comparing the intervention and control groups. After adjusting for baseline measurement and age, only differential reduction in diastolic blood pressure remained significant. There was no significant change in HbA(1c) and no difference between the groups. Conclusions Using link workers and extra community diabetes specialist nurse input together with treatment protocols in primary care might prove a useful strategy in working towards NSF targets for diabetes management. In this study, small reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol were achieved. Improvement in glycaemic control may require longer and possibly different strategies. Further research is required to evaluate fully the effectiveness, including the costs and longer term sustainability of culturally sensitive initiatives.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.4316752254962921, 0.46459323167800903, 0.5277023911476135, 0.5460179448127747, 0.2988959550857544, 0.5350496768951416, 0.45608770847320557, 0.43079736828804016, 0.6228746771812439]"

Women attending a publically-funded prenatal clinic were randomly assigned to a paraprofessional. A comparison group matched for ethnicity, parity and trimester entering prenatal care was also selected. Women followed by a paraprofessional had significantly more prenatal appointments (8.0 vs 6.5 visits) and infants with average higher birthweight (3125 grams) over the matched comparison group (3273 grams).

No differences in life satisfaction or physical activity were found, but loneliness predicted positive mood, and positive mood predicted physical activity. This investigation points to the benefits of using Wii for well-being, particularly social connection and enjoyment.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.44622257351875305, 0.47171568870544434, 0.5340116620063782, 0.5678502917289734, 0.28854745626449585, 0.5198602676391602, 0.47288694977760315, 0.4240403175354004, 0.6243551969528198]"
27,"variation in the effect of communities that care on community adoption of a scientific approach to prevention Tested and effective approaches are available to prevent mental, emotional, and behavioral problems in youth, but such approaches are underused. Communities That Care (CTC) is a coalition-based strategy that aims to increase the use of tested and effective programs by combining the use of scientific evidence and stakeholder consensus to support the community adoption of a scientific approach to preventing mental, emotional, and behavioral problems in youth. A community-randomized trial of CTC was conducted with a sample of 24 communities matched in pairs and assigned randomly to a control or an intervention condition. The findings demonstrate that CTC significantly increases the community-wide adoption of a science-based approach to prevention. Using a meta-analysis technique, this study shows that despite uniformly high-fidelity implementation of CTC in intervention communities, the effect of CTC on the adoption of a scientific approach to prevention varies significantly across the 12 community pairs. Understanding the extent of variation in the effect of CTC on adopting a science-based approach to prevention lays a foundation for identifying aspects of coalition structure, functioning, or capacity that not only may help explain variation in adoption, but may in turn be targeted to strengthen the effect of CTC on the adoption of a science-based approach to prevention within communities.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.45845070481300354, 0.5819384455680847, 0.4657069444656372, 0.5878989696502686, 0.34004634618759155, 0.514197826385498, 0.38034263253211975, 0.32959267497062683, 0.48039624094963074]"
28,"a matrix mentoring model that effectively supports clinical and translational scientists and increases inclusion in biomedical research lessons from the university of utah Physician-scientists and scientists in all the health professions are vital members of the U.S. biomedical workforce, but their numbers at academic health centers are declining. Mentorship has been identified as a key component in retention of faculty members at academic health centers. Effective mentoring may promote the retention of clinician-scientists in the biomedical workforce. The authors describe a holistic institutional mentoring program to support junior faculty members engaged in clinical and translational science at the University of Utah. The clinical and translational scholars (CATS) program leverages the resources of the institution, including the Center for Clinical and Translational Science, to augment departmental resources to support junior faculty investigators and uses a multilevel mentoring matrix that includes self, senior, scientific, peer, and staff mentorship. Begun in the Department of Pediatrics, the program was expanded in 2013 to include all departments in the school of medicine and the health sciences. During the two-year program, scholars learn management essentials and have leadership training designed to develop principal investigators. Of the 86 program participants since fiscal year 2008, 92% have received extramural awards, 99% remain in academic medicine, and 95% remain at the University of Utah. The CATS program has also been associated with increased inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities in the institutional research enterprise. The CATS program manifests institutional collaboration and coordination of resources, which have benefited faculty members and the institution. The model can be applied to other academic health centers to support and sustain the biomedical workforce.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0.45415887236595154, 0.478975385427475, 0.5357847213745117, 0.5496960878372192, 0.2877546548843384, 0.4983160197734833, 0.5044840574264526, 0.44027310609817505, 0.6319770216941833]"

0,"strategies for recruiting african american residents of public housing developments into a randomized controlled trial Objectives Two community-based strategies used to implement a clinical trial within public housing developments are discussed: 1) hiring and training community outreach residents (CORE) team members to recruit and retain primarily African-American participants; and 2) conducting health fairs to recruit participants into a trial examining the effects of nicotine gum and motivational interviewing on smoking cessation rates. Design A cluster randomized, community-based clinical trial. Setting This trial was conducted in housing developments within a metropolitan area in the Midwest. Participants Over a period of 20 months, the research team recruited 813 residents, 80% of whom were African-American, to attend health fairs. Of this number, 273 (33%) smokers were identified, and 173 were ultimately enrolled into the study. Results Attendance at health fairs of public housing development residents ranged from 8%-66% across the housing developments, with an average of 21%. A brief survey was conducted at the health fair to assess smoking status, fruit/vegetable consumption, and physical activity. Conclusions A number of possible explanations for the relatively high participation rates among a community-based trial include engaging the community in the research process, offering free health screening services, building recruitment incentives for the CORE, and tailoring health education/promotion materials according to the demographic make-up of the developments. Details regarding the development of recruitment strategies that may boost recruitment rates in community-based clinical trials with predominantly ethnic minorities are provided.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999966621398926, 0.9999991655349731, 0.00034118149778805673, 4.565081781038316e-06, 3.7000157249167387e-07, 3.046621259272797e-06, 0.9999982118606567, 5.629105999105377e-07, 5.375081286729255e-07]"

2,"recruitment of african american adults as research participants for a language in aging study example of a principled creative and culture based approach Recruitment of African Americans as research participants continues as a major challenge for researchers studying health and human behavior. Numerous reasons for low participation by African Americans have been cited, most of which evolve around four primary factors: social injustice, education, economics, and cultural differences. To ensure adequate representation of the diversity within the U.S. population in research, the federal government mandates the inclusion of individuals from underrepresented groups as study participants. For African Americans, this number is approximately 12%. Controversy exists, however, as to whether published research studies reflect adequate representation of African Americans as study participants. This article reports a successful approach to the recruitment and retention of 80 African American adults who participated in a study investigating language comprehension in aging. J Allied Health. 2002; 31:241-246. LOW PARTICIPATION IN research studies by African Americans and other culturally and linguistically diverse groups (including Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans) continues to be problematic for researchers. In the communication sciences and disorders literature, for example, researchers report that racial-ethnic minorities are largely underrepresented in research population samples and data sources.1-3 This underrepresentation has important implications for clinical management of individuals from these groups. In a review of the literature, Ness et al.4 concluded that current literature does not reflect fully the differential recruitment rates among African Americans and other underrepresented populations compared with whites and suggested that reporting of this information needs to be vigorously done. Researchers frequently verbalize the continuing and increasing difficulty of recruiting African American study participants. Ashing-Giwa 5 cited two important biomedical and behavioral reasons why African Americans must be represented in scientific research. First, greater mortality and morbidity in this population necessitate that research be done using greater numbers of African Americans. Second, research findings from other populations (e.g., whites) may not be appropriate and applicable to African Americans-- one can know only if these individuals are included as study participants. Stroke research showing occlusive lesion distribution differences between African Americans and whites (e.g., intracranial versus extracranial),6 has important implications for treatment in these populations. In an effort to address these issues, the National Institutes of Health, the federal government s primary research funding agency, mandates the inclusion of underrepresented groups as research participants.7 Funding is linked to adequate representation of these groups in research. Appropriate and socially responsible inclusion of African Americans as research participants would inform health care management of these individuals. The ultimate payoff is a substantial reduction in the overall financial burden to the U.S. health care system. This article addresses this urgent need by 1) considering the range of ways researchers have recommended recruiting African Americans and 2) elaborating, in depth, on a particularly successful set of recruitment strategies undertaken in one study by the author. Brief Historical Perspective Much of the resistance by African Americans to participate in research has to do with a legacy of injustices, such as the Tuskegee syphilis study,8 one of the most egregious and publicized examples. The outcome of this study provided the impetus for the development and implementation of current ethical practices in subject recruitment and treatment in research. From 1932 to 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service examined the course of syphilis in African American men in Macon County, Alabama. Enlisting the support of the prestigious Tuskegee Institute, 399 poor African American sharecroppers with syphilis were denied available treatment, although they were told that they would receive weekly medication treatments for this deadly disease. …","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[4.723774793546909e-07, 0.9999988079071045, 8.191188499040436e-06, 6.276288786466466e-06, 3.525462375364441e-07, 2.0711902379844105e-06, 9.785150041352608e-07, 4.607234131981386e-07, 1.9359599718882237e-06]"
3,"a novel food pantry program food security self sufficiency and diet quality outcomes Background The number of food pantries in the U.S. has grown dramatically over 3 decades, yet food insecurity remains a persistent public health problem. Purpose The goal of the study was to examine the impact of a food pantry intervention called Freshplace, designed to promote food security. Design Randomized parallel-group study with equal randomization. Setting/participants Data were collected from June 2010 to June 2012; a total of 228 adults were recruited over 1 year from traditional food pantries and randomized to the Freshplace intervention (n=113) or control group (n=115), with quarterly follow-ups for 12 months. Intervention The Freshplace intervention included a client-choice pantry, monthly meetings with a project manager to receive motivational interviewing, and targeted referrals to community services. Control group participants went to traditional food pantries where they received bags of food. Main outcome measures Data analyses were conducted from July 2012 to January 2013. Outcomes were food security, self-sufficiency, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Multivariate regression models were used to predict the three outcomes, controlling for gender, age, household size, income, and presence of children in the household. Results At baseline, half of the sample experienced very low food security. Over 1 year, Freshplace members were less than half as likely to experience very low food security, increased self-sufficiency by 4.1 points, and increased fruits and vegetables by one serving per day compared to the control group, all outcomes p Conclusions Freshplace may serve as a model for other food pantries to promote food security rather than short-term assistance by addressing the underlying causes of poverty.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9935465455055237, 0.9999920129776001, 1.203496412927052e-05, 6.093745014368324e-06, 3.6633565514421207e-07, 0.9998633861541748, 0.9999986886978149, 7.047516987768176e-07, 6.92821117809217e-07]"

5,"racial disparities in participation in biomedical research To determine whether minority patients were less likely to participate in biomedical research, perceive positive benefits from such participation, or to recommend research participation to other patients, an observational study was conducted. Sociodemographic and survey data were collected from 5436 users of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Ambulatory Care, which included questions about veterans research participation and related attitudes. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine if there were racial differences in the outcomes of interest, controlling for relevant sociodemographic factors. Bivariate and multivariate analyses indicated that there were no racial differences in self-reported research participation, but minority veterans were more likely to perceive a positive effect of research and less likely to recommend research to other veterans. However, subgroup analyses indicated that, of those veterans having negative attitudes about research, minority and less educated veterans were disproportionately represented. In the VA system, racial differences in research participation may dissipate because many sociodemographic factors are controlled. Although we did not observe consistent racial differences in research participation or attitudes, the fact that minority veterans were disproportionately represented among the group with the most negative attitudes about research suggests that further research is necessary to fully understand the racial dynamics of research participation in the VA.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[4.904950401396491e-07, 0.9999762773513794, 0.0003462960012257099, 7.358614675467834e-05, 3.683633451601054e-07, 1.989353222597856e-06, 8.828141631056496e-07, 1.0517383088881616e-06, 1.0050134733319283e-06]"

7,"sometimes they don t stop they just slow down A research project conducted by the Middlesex University Transport Management Research Centre on children s perceptions of the road environment, its attendant risks and the effect on their road crossing behaviour is described. One primary and three secondary schools in the London Boroughs of Barnet, Enfield and Haringey participated in the project. Many children were frightened or frustrated by their lack of control over the behaviour of drivers at designated crossing points. Crossing with a group of others promoted a sense of confidence. There was confusion over the functions of some engineering features, e.g. raised platforms used to slow traffic down and also to act as a pedestrian crossing. Children tended to cross the road at the first available location even when the road was initially not clear. They therefore tended to cross in two different places when traversing the route in opposite directions. Children s choice of crossing point was sometimes influenced by their social behaviour.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999995231628418, 0.9579097032546997, 1.6706551832612604e-05, 0.9999269247055054, 8.739481245356728e-07, 6.465447768277954e-06, 0.9999282360076904, 1.146143290498003e-06, 2.369949243075098e-06]"
8,"the effectiveness of a community academic health center partnership in decreasing the level of blood pressure in an urban african american population This study investigated the effectiveness of a community-academic health center partnership, utilizing nurse-supervised indigenous community health workers, in decreasing the blood pressure in an urban African-American population. A four-year randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Sandtown-Winchester community, which has an excess prevalence of high blood pressure, in order to test the effectiveness of 2 different levels of intervention intensity on increasing the control of high blood pressure. Community health workers were trained and certified in blood pressure management, monitoring, education and counseling, social support mobilization, and community outreach and follow up. The primary results were a significant decrease in mean systolic and diastolic pressures after both levels of intervention, and a significant increase in the percentage of individuals with controlled high blood pressure. Surprisingly, no differences in results were observed between the 2 levels of intervention intensity. This study supports the use of community-based partnership efforts, and the utilization of indigenous health workers, to enhance the control of high blood pressure in a high-risk, African-American urban population.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999969005584717, 0.9999991655349731, 1.1913530215679202e-05, 5.481856078404235e-06, 4.0483664065504854e-07, 0.9259832501411438, 0.9999991655349731, 5.35456649686239e-07, 5.767033144365996e-07]"

This randomized trial evaluated the impact of mammography‐enhancing interventions implemented in 40 senior citizens’ housing facilities in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Methods. After stratification of the facilities according to the socioeconomic status and racial backgrounds of their residents, they were randomly assigned to one of four groups to receive the following: 1) standard care—a Medicare mammography benefit flier; 2) education— the flier and a community education program; 3) access—the flier, mammography appointments, and transportation; 4) combined—all interventions. Telephone surveys, conducted prior to any intervention, identified mammography‐eligible women, who were re‐surveyed six months later to ascertain mammography use. Results.

13,"dancers in the dark scientific careers according to a gender blind model of promotion AbstractThe disparity between men and women in science is a hot topic in gender studies and a relevant target of scientific policies. The leaky pipeline metaphor illustrates the decreasing number of women along senior positions in academia; however many questions remain unanswered. What factors progressively diminish the number of women in scientific careers and why do they appear to be less successful than their male colleagues? In order to discover new insight, this work compares men’s and women’s career paths by taking into account academic and family milestones achieved throughout the life course. An innovative and interdisciplinary methodology (from bibliometrics, statistics, and sociology) has been constructed to examine men’s and women’s trajectories. Findings display gender differences in scientists’ trajectories. The evolution of scientists’ careers reveals linear careers for males, whilst women develop non-linear careers.

15,"peer and community leader education to prevent youth violence The program described here tests the effectiveness of a community-based and school-based program to reduce violence among African-American and Hispanic adolescents. The program methods are based on social network theory research, which has found that key lay people in communities can be identified and trained to carry out prevention programs. The educational content is based on theories suggesting that characteristics of healthy, adaptive individuals and communities can be taught. A violence-prevention leadership program is provided to a cohort of middle-school student peer leaders and their parents and for the leaders of the neighborhoods around the middle schools. Three matched pairs of urban middle-school attendance zones were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or serve as a nonintervention control group. Surveys, interviews, and observations were conducted with the peer leaders, their parents, community leaders, and community residents. Sixty-six percent of the peer leaders reported that they had hit someone in the past 30 days. Twenty-six percent of the sixth-graders had punched or beaten someone in the past 30 days. Within the past year, 6% of the adults had slapped or kicked someone. Within the past 30 days, 14% of the sixth-graders had been punched or beaten. Within the past year, 6% of the adults had been punched or beaten. A large percentage of adolescents are victims and perpetrators of violence and are exposed to violence in their neighborhoods.

To ensure that such research is useful, benefits the lesbian community, and expands the understanding of lesbian health conditions, particular attention needs to be paid to the methods and definitions used and to the involvement of the lesbian community in designing, implementing, and analyzing the research itself.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[6.94769084930158e-07, 1.9850663193210494e-06, 1.0297789231117349e-05, 1.1066095794376452e-05, 4.078429469700495e-07, 1.4394964864550275e-06, 9.288039564125938e-07, 6.326566222014662e-07, 0.9999953508377075]"
17,"promoting handwashing and sanitation evidence from a large scale randomized trial in rural tanzania The association between hygiene, sanitation, and health is well documented, yet thousands of children die each year from exposure to contaminated fecal matter. At the same time, evidence on the effectiveness of at-scale behavior change interventions to improve sanitation and hygiene practices is limited. This paper presents the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania. For the campaign, 181 wards were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together, or neither. One year after the end of the program, sanitation wards increased latrine construction rates from 38.6 to 51 percent and reduced regular open defecation from 23.1 to 11.1 percent. Households in handwashing wards show marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation, but not at other critical junctures. Limited interaction is observed between handwashing and sanitation on intermediate outcomes: wards that received both handwashing and sanitation promotion are less likely to have feces visible around their latrine and more likely to have a handwashing station close to their latrine facility relative to individual treatment groups. Final health effects on child health measured through diarrhea, anemia, stunting, and wasting are absent in the single-intervention groups. The combined-treatment group produces statistically detectable, but biologically insignificant and inconsistent, health impacts. The results highlight the importance of focusing on intermediate outcomes of take-up and behavior change as a critical first step in large-scale programs before realizing the changes in health that sanitation and hygiene interventions aim to deliver.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 1.2044272352795815e-06, 0.9977512955665588, 0.9999886751174927, 0.9999984502792358, 0.999997615814209, 1.0866576758417068e-06, 5.457363272398652e-07, 5.363336299524235e-07]"

The bulk of research has indicated that boys’ attitudes towards the subject tend to be more positive and that participation (in both curricular and extra‐curricular activities) is generally looked upon as being more readily compatible with prevailing notions of masculinity than femininity. In this paper we present the findings of a recent survey which suggests that girls may now be less likely than in the recent past to perceive PE as a ‘masculine’ subject.’,"[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.4971734572100104e-06, 1.6321587281709071e-06, 9.420984133612365e-05, 0.9999926090240479, 4.742615828945418e-07, 2.4526270863134414e-06, 2.0799307094421238e-06, 5.650076104757318e-07, 0.34260082244873047]"

The intervention model employed was based on previous research with gay men (Kelly, St. Lawrence, Diaz, et al., 1991; Kelly, St. Lawrence, Stevenson, et al., 1992) and inspired by diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 1995). The effects of the current intervention were assessed on a sample of 1,741 male prostitutes and bar patrons. Analyses indicated significant reductions in paid, unprotected sexual intercourse and oral sex following the intervention. Analyses further indicated that the data were partially consistent with the program s model, which specified that norms were the putative mediator of behavior change in the intervention. Also, the intervention s effects varied by bar and by participants race/ethnicity. Data support the utility of the intervention model for an urban sample of men at high risk for HIV infection.

We develop a decomposition technique that allows us to compare the relative importance of the adverse family characteristics and home environments of low income children in accounting for different outcomes. Using rich cohort data from the UK we find that poor children are disadvantaged at age 7 to 9 across the full spectrum of outcomes, the gradient being strongest for cognitive outcomes and weakest for physical health. We find that some aspects of environment appear to be associated with the full range of outcomes - for example, maternal smoking and breastfeeding, child nutrition, parental psychological functioning. We also find some some aspects of the environment of higher income households hinder child development. We conclude that many aspects of growing up in poverty are harmful to children’s development, and that narrowly-targeted interventions are unlikely to have a significant impact on intergenerational mobility.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[7.000673463153362e-07, 1.4183947314450052e-06, 1.8508701032260433e-05, 4.696334599429974e-06, 3.7326071833376773e-07, 3.4111419608962024e-06, 0.9999991655349731, 5.047371587352245e-07, 9.74545855569886e-07]"

26,"leader behaviors group cohesion and participation in a walking group program Introduction Less than half of all U.S. adults meet the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines. Leader behaviors and group cohesion have been associated with increased participation or adherence in sports team and exercise class settings. Physical activity interventions in community settings that encompass these factors may enhance intervention adherence. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of Community Health Promoter leader behaviors and group cohesion on participation in a walking group intervention among racially/ethnically diverse adults in low to moderate–income communities in Detroit, Michigan. Design Data for the current study were drawn from the Walk Your Heart to Health (WYHH) data set. WYHH was a multisite cluster RCT with a lagged intervention and outcome measurements at baseline and 4, 8, and 32 weeks. Pooled survey data from both intervention arms were used for the current study. Data were analyzed between August 2013 and October 2014. Setting/participants A total of 603 non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic adults across five cohorts that began the 32-week WYHH intervention between March 2009 and October 2011. Intervention The intervention was a 32-week walking group program hosted by community- and faith-based organizations and facilitated by Community Health Promoters. Walking groups met three times per week for 90 minutes per session. To promote participation in or adherence to WYHH, Community Health Promoters used evidence-based strategies to facilitate group cohesion. Group members assumed increasing leadership responsibility for facilitating sessions over time. Main outcome measures Participation in WYHH as measured by consistency of attendance. Results Community Health Promoter leader behaviors were positively associated with participation in WYHH. Social but not task cohesion was significantly associated with consistent participation. Social cohesion may mediate the relationship between leader behaviors and walking group participation. Conclusions Providing leaders with training to build socially cohesive groups may help motivate individuals to continue participation in community-based physical activity programs.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]","[8.567379836676992e-07, 0.9999985694885254, 0.0007772460812702775, 0.9999836683273315, 3.3792542808441794e-07, 0.9999972581863403, 0.9999991655349731, 5.003385581403563e-07, 0.9999986886978149]"

This study presents the first comprehensive quantification of women on these boards and the implications for women in medicine. METHODS: The numbers of women and men on professional society and journal editorial boards across 28 specialties (March 2004) were counted. The number of women holding multiple roles on these boards and the number of women holding top leadership positions on these boards were counted, and these proportions were compared. RESULTS: Three-thousand-four-hundred-seventy-three individuals on 39 professional medical society boards and 54 journal editorial boards were included. Eighty-three percent (2,884) of board members were male. Men occupied > 80% of top leadership positions on these boards. Thirty-five of the 589 women in the study held multiple roles. Anesthesiology (p < 0.0025), pediatrics (p < 0.0001), dermatology (p = 0.0001), obstetrics/ gynecology (p = 0.05), medical genetics (p < 0.015) and rehabilitation medicine (p < 0.03) had significantly lower proportions of women on boards in comparison to the total women in the specialty. Internal medicine, plastic surgery, cardiology and general surgery had nearly equivalent proportions; in otolaryngology and family medicine, female board members slightly exceeded the proportion of women in the field.

29,"a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a web based computer tailored self management intervention for people with or at risk for copd INTRODUCTION: COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Self-management interventions are considered important in order to limit the progression of the disease. Computer-tailored interventions could be an effective tool to facilitate self-management. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of a web-based, computer-tailored COPD self-management intervention on physical activity and smoking behavior. Participants were recruited from an online panel and through primary care practices. Those at risk for or diagnosed with COPD, between 40 and 70 years of age, proficient in Dutch, with access to the Internet, and with basic computer skills (n=1,325), were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=662) or control group (n=663). The intervention group received the web-based self-management application, while the control group received no intervention. Participants were not blinded to group assignment. After 6 months, the effect of the intervention was assessed for the primary outcomes, smoking cessation and physical activity, by self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form. RESULTS: Of the 1,325 participants, 1,071 (80.8%) completed the 6-month follow-up questionnaire. No significant treatment effect was found on either outcome. The application however, was used by only 36% of the participants in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: A possible explanation for the nonsignificant effect on the primary outcomes, smoking cessation and physical activity, could be the low exposure to the application as engagement with the program has been shown to be crucial for the effectiveness of computer-tailored interventions.

The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent TPB constructs, including intention, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, and perceived social norms, measured at age 25 predicted four eating behaviours (intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, total fat and added sugar) eight years later. Two hundred and forty men and 279 women that participated in the Oslo Youth Study were followed from 1991 to 1999 (mean age 25 and 33 years, respectively). Questionnaires at baseline (1991) included the constructs of the TPB and dietary habits, and at follow-up (1999) questionnaires included demographic factors and diet. For the assessment of diet, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with a few food items was used at baseline while an extensive semi-quantitative FFQ was used at follow-up. Among men, attitudes, subjective norms and previous eating behaviour were significant predictors of fruit and vegetable intake, while education and past eating behaviour were predictive of whole grain intake in multivariate analyses predicting dietary intake at follow-up. For women, perceived behavioural control, perceived social norms and past behaviour were predictive of fruit and vegetable intake, while subjective norms, education and past eating behaviour were predictive of whole grain intake. For total fat intake, intention was predictive for men and perceived behavioural control for women. Household income and past consumption of sugar-rich foods were significant predictors of added sugar intake among men, while past intake of sugar-rich foods was a significant predictor of added sugar intake among women. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, all psychosocial factors assessed among young adults appeared predictive of one or more eating behaviours reported eight years later. Results point to the influence of psychosocial factors on future eating behaviours and the potential for interventions targeting such factors.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999910593032837, 2.031164513027761e-06, 0.9974988102912903, 1.5968158550094813e-05, 3.4976534379893565e-07, 0.9997612833976746, 0.9999958276748657, 9.808882168726996e-07, 6.117958264439949e-07]"
31,"walking the walk community participation in hia a qualitative interview study Abstract Although community participation is seen as central to the practice of health impact assessment (HIA), effective engagement of local people is notoriously difficult to achieve and risks being tokenistic. This qualitative study, set in a deprived estate in northwest England, examined how community participation in the proposed HIA of a Regeneration Masterplan would be affected by the attitudes and experiences of key stakeholders. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 stakeholders drawn from officials, representatives and local residents linked to the regeneration programme. The results suggest that there may be a large gap between professional rhetoric and the reality of community participation, and that barriers to community participation in HIA may be substantial and institutionalised. If these barriers are to be overcome, it is essential to acknowledge the existence of this rhetoric-reality gap and to address the training and resource needs of both professionals and community members.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.6670088768005371, 0.0015836729435250163, 3.7814963434357196e-05, 4.380799509817734e-06, 3.514157072004309e-07, 2.74578997050412e-06, 0.9999973773956299, 2.0763616248586914e-06, 1.040728989210038e-06]"
32,"iron deficiency anemia higher prevalence in mexican american than in non hispanic white females in the third national health and nutrition examination survey 1988 1994 Background Mexican American females have a higher prevalence of iron deficiency than do non-Hispanic white females. Objective The objective was to estimate the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia and examine potential reasons for this difference between Mexican American (n = 1194) and non-Hispanic white (n = 1183) females aged 12-39 y. Design We used data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994). Iron deficiency anemia was defined as abnormal results from >/=2 of 3 tests (erythrocyte protoporphyrin, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin) and a low hemoglobin concentration. We used multiple logistic regression to adjust for factors that were more prevalent in Mexican American females and significantly associated with iron deficiency anemia. Results The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 6.2 +/- 0.8% (f1.gif BORDER= 0 > +/- SE) in Mexican American females and 2.3 +/- 0.4% in non-Hispanic white females. Mean dietary iron intake, mean serum vitamin C concentrations, and the proportion of females using oral contraceptives were similar in the 2 groups. Age 3.0, however, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 2.6 +/- 0.9% in Mexican American and 1.9 +/- 0.6% in non-Hispanic white females (NS). Conclusion Although much of the ethnic disparity in iron deficiency anemia remains unexplained, factors associated with household income may be involved.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[6.276943622651743e-07, 0.9999983310699463, 0.22353291511535645, 1.1625532351899892e-05, 3.5298762668389827e-07, 3.571761453713407e-06, 0.9985507130622864, 9.78347088675946e-07, 8.32636601444392e-07]"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based bicycle helmet promotion program in increasing helmet use by children while controlling for secular trends. Two high-income and two low-income schools in an urban Canadian community were selected to receive a bicycle helmet promotion intervention, with the remaining 18 schools serving as controls. Approximately 1800 observations of bicycling children were made at randomly selected observational sites 2 to 5 months after the intervention to assess changes in behavior. Helmet use at all observation sites tripled from 3.4% (1990, preintervention) to 16% (1991, postintervention). In the high-income intervention area, observed helmet use rose dramatically from 4% to 36% in contrast to the more modest increase in the high-income control area from 4% to 15%. In the low-income intervention area, there was a modest increase from 1% to 7%, but it did not differ from the increase in the low-income control area from 3% to 13%. The program was highly successful in children of high-income families but not in children of low-income families.

35,"reasons underlying low fish consumption where availability is not an issue a case study in brazil one of the world s largest fish producers This research investigated consumer behavior toward fish in a population with low fish consumption, using the theory of planned behavior. A questionnaire was run on a sample of 200 fish consumers in the city of Rio Grande (RS, Brazil). The low frequency of fish consumption could be due to different barriers: a perceived difficulty in buying, preparing, cooking, the belief that it is expensive or the unpleasant sensory properties linked to fish (fishbones or smell). But there can also be cultural parameters determining habits and low consumption. Exploring the individual factors that determine fish consumption makes it possible to develop public policy strategies. Results showed that attitudes toward eating fish, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control all had a significant positive influence on the intention to eat fish. Intention and attitude both proved significant determinants of fish consumption frequency, with attitude inversely correlated to fish consumption. Habit appeared as an important discriminating variable for the consumption of fish. The findings show that the sampled population could be potentially bigger consumers of fish with the correct promotion strategies. The Brazilian government should plan campaigns to promote the habit of eating fish that use the idea of health-consciousness, target younger people and increase the appeals to give the family healthy food. Practical Applications The practical application of the theory of planned behavior as a tool to study a population with low fish consumption is that it aids the understanding of the factors and barriers influencing this behavior and facilitates planning for future changes in eating behavior.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999990463256836, 0.9997957348823547, 0.009423426352441311, 1.0749142347776797e-05, 3.508665145091072e-07, 0.9999979734420776, 0.00076812575571239, 5.825466473652341e-07, 5.759530949944747e-07]"

Socioeconomic status (SES) influenced the valuation of benefits. Also, the poorest households consumed more of the cheaper drug and less of the more expensive drug (P < 0.05). The least poor households mostly paid in full, whereas the poorest households paid mostly through installments (P < 0.05). The use of CHWs improved overall geographic but not socioeconomic equity to the drugs. Hence, interventions for timely and appropriate treatment of malaria should be accompanied by drug delivery and payment strategies that would ensure SES equity in consumption of appropriate malaria treatment services.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999991655349731, 6.823787316534435e-06, 0.9931615591049194, 7.479670784960035e-06, 5.479932951857336e-06, 0.005166089162230492, 0.999997615814209, 6.805880730098579e-07, 5.236469405645039e-06]"

Lay-led education may overcome cultural and language barriers that limit the effectiveness of professionally–led programmes. We report the first randomised trial of a lay-led self-management programme — the Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme (CDSMP) (Expert Patient Programme) — in a south Asian group. Aim To determine the effectiveness of a culturally-adapted lay–led self-management programme for Bangladeshi adults with chronic disease. Design of study Randomised controlled trial. Setting Tower Hamlets, east London. Method We recruited Bangladeshi adults with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease or arthritis from general practices and randomised them to the CDSMP or waiting-list control. Self-efficacy (primary outcome), self-management behaviour, communication with clinician, depression scores, and healthcare use were assessed by blinded interviewer-administered questionnaires in Sylheti before randomisation and 4 months later. Results Of the 1363 people invited, 476 (34%) agreed to take part and 92% (439/476) of participants were followed up. The programme improved self-efficacy (difference: 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08 to 1.25) and self-management behaviour (0.53; 95% CI = 0.01 to 1.06). In the 51% (121/238) of intervention participants attending three or more of the 6-weekly education sessions the programme led to greater improvements in self-efficacy (1.47; 95% CI = 0.50 to 1.82) and self-management behaviour (1.16; 95% CI = 0.50 to 1.82), and reduced HADS depression scores (0.64; 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.22). Communication and healthcare use were not significantly different between groups. The programme cost £123 (€181) per participant.

Additionally, the aim was to test if these relations vary by behaviour (physical activity or dietary behaviour) or intervention intensity (frequency). Design. It was a randomized controlled trial with a ‘usual care’ condition (medical screening only) and an intervention condition (medical screening+access to a website and coaching). Participants in the latter condition could freely determine their own intervention intensity. Methods. Participants (N= 287) completed measures of the theoretical constructs and behaviour at baseline and after the first intervention year (N= 236). Partial least squares path modelling was used. Results. Changes in autonomous motivation positively predicted changes in self-efficacy and intentions towards a healthy diet. Changes in controlled motivation positively predicted changes in attitudes towards physical activity, changes in self-efficacy, and changes in behavioural intentions. The intervention intensity moderated the effect of self-efficacy on intentions towards physical activity and the relationship between attitude and physical activity. Changes in physical activity were positively predicted by changes in intentions whereas desired changes in fat intake were negatively predicted by the intervention intensity.

The study observed the impact of large-scale intervention that includes a mass media provincial campaign and a district-level community component on hand washing knowledge or hand washing behavior on the household level. The mass media intervention alone was not effective in reaching the targeted population with hand washing messages and failed to improve knowledge and beliefs of mothers and caregivers around hand washing behavior. The district level interventions were effective at getting their message to the target audience. The treated group was 19.4 percent more likely to report having received the messages. Care givers knowledge about hand washing increased by 6 percent and the availability of soap and water within the household increased by 8.4 percent.

The curriculum, taught by science teachers, consisted of twelve classroom sessions using both didactic and interactive exercises covering sex education, HIV biology, drug use, decision-making and refusal skills, and public response to AIDS and community resources. Changes from baseline of self-reported responses to questions on pre- and posttests concerning AIDS knowledge and misconceptions, tolerance toward persons with AIDS, and high-risk behaviors were compared between intervention and control schools. Students in the intervention schools had a significant increase in AIDS knowledge (p < .0001) and became more tolerant of people with AIDS (p < .001) compared with students in the control school. Changes in high risk behavior could not be detected, perhaps due to the small number of sexually active students (24% of the sample). Students who increased their AIDS knowledge (p < .0001) as a result of the intervention became more tolerant of people with AIDS.

44,"emphasizing the losses or the gains comparing situational and individual moderators of framed messages to promote fruit and vegetable intake Health messages are a commonly used way to promote changes in dietary habits but their efficacy could be enhanced by strategies such as the way in which the presented arguments are framed. This study aimed to test the effectiveness of framed messages (gain vs. loss) on behavioural intention and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake, comparing predictions based on prominent theoretical perspectives on message framing (function of the health behaviour and recipients motivational orientation) and by further exploring the role of baseline intentions as a potential moderator of the framing effects. Undergraduate students (N = 180) completed the three assessment points in time. At baseline, individual moderators (motivational orientation and intentions) and fruit and vegetable intake were assessed. One week later, participants were randomly assigned to the loss or gain-framed message and indicated their intentions for FV intake the following week. A week later, FV intake over the previous week was assessed. The gain-frame was not conducive, per se, to higher intentions or behaviour. Having intention as the outcome, only baseline intentions moderated the effects of message frame. When considering FV intake as the outcome, both motivational orientation and baseline intentions moderated the effects of message frame, with the loss-frame promoting higher FV intake among individuals who were prevention-oriented and had higher baseline intentions. Findings suggest that the success of framed messages for FV intake depends upon the recipient s characteristics, such as motivational orientation, baseline intentions, and cultural background, with implications for health communication interventions.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999923706054688, 0.9999953508377075, 1.570162748976145e-05, 1.044633609126322e-05, 3.5056348224316025e-07, 0.9999768733978271, 8.927904104893969e-07, 1.6591142184552155e-06, 5.779272669315105e-07]"

46,"a spatial equity analysis of a public health intervention a case study of an outdoor walking group provider within local authorities in england If an intervention is not well spatially targeted, appropriate levels of uptake, efficacy, long-term compliance and improved health outcomes are unlikely to be attained. Effective health interventions should seek to achieve not only absolute improvements in health but also to reduce inequity. There is often a disparity whereby preventative interventions are more likely to be successful amongst the more affluent, a process which has been coined the ‘inverse prevention law’. Physical inactivity is known to be socially patterned and disproportionately prevalent in disadvantaged communities yet there is a lack of clear evidence on which interventions have the potential to influence inequity. Walking groups have been found to have multiple health benefits and increase physical activity. In England the major facilitator is a not for profit organisation which has 70,000 regular walkers and is lay led with 10,000 volunteers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which walking groups operated in those places with the greatest health need and whether consequently the scheme has the potential to influence health inequity. The work used a spatial approach whereby geographical variations in walking group provision within the 326 local authorities in England (mean population 163,410) were linked to health and socio-economic measures of population need. Generally, greater need was not associated with higher provision of the walking group intervention. Although the magnitude of differences was small, provision of the intervention tended to be poorest in those local authorities with the greatest health need, as measured by our indicators. Without targeting those areas with greater health and socio-economic need, there is a concern that walking groups may not be set up in areas that need them most. There is therefore a potential that this intervention could, albeit in a small way, widen inequity between local authorities. However small-scale and well-intentioned, interventions need to be evaluated for their potential impact on inequity.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0.00020021248201373965, 0.026538850739598274, 0.047419387847185135, 0.00042055977974087, 3.5417863841757935e-07, 0.9628784656524658, 0.9999974966049194, 1.027844177770021e-06, 6.798855451961572e-07]"

48,"under representation of women on dental journal editorial boards Introduction Each journal’s editorial and advisory board plays a critical role in resolving gender bias in the peer-review and publication process. Thus, this study aimed to quantify women’s participation in editorial and advisory boards of major dental journals. Gender data on editorial and advisory boards were extracted from major dental journals, which were then categorized by journal specialty focus. The gender of the editor-in-chief and associate editor-in-chief was noted to assess the effect of journal leadership on women’s participation in journal boards. For comparison purposes, data were also obtained regarding the percentage of women faculty for each dental specialty. Results Overall, in the major 69 dental journals, 14.8% of editorial board members were women. An one-way ANOVA analysis revealed statistically significant gender differences between journal specialty categories (p = 0.003) with some dental specialties’ journals demonstrating a relatively high participation of women as editorial board members. There was a significant positive correlation for various dental specialties between women’s representation in editorial and advisory boards and women in similar dental academic specialties (p = 0.02, r2 = 0.55). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the presence of women in journal editorial leadership and the percentage of women serving as advisory board members (p = 0.03). Our results confirmed that the under-representation of women on dental journal editorial boards was significantly different between dental science specialties. When there were more women in journal editorial leadership positions, there was a higher participation of women as editorial and advisory board members. Journals should increase the numbers of women on editorial boards in order to secure diversity, improve publication quality and recognize women’s contribution to dental science.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[4.44627289652999e-07, 9.92503601082717e-07, 1.1216160601179581e-05, 0.9999933242797852, 3.8416183656408975e-07, 1.6741819308663253e-06, 7.930636911623878e-07, 7.290532266779337e-07, 8.368446060558199e-07]"

The overwhelming majority of ‘trained’ pupils do not in fact wash their hands with soap after using the toilet and before eating (even though the importance of such practices is well established and has almost certainly been emphasized in hygiene classes) and open defecation still appears to be relatively widespread even in intervention schools.

Methods.All 41 public housing high-rise buildings were randomized to treatment and delayed treatment (control) conditions. After a cross-sectional baseline survey, an intervention called Friend to Friend was conducted in the treatment buildings by American Cancer Society and building resident volunteers. The intervention consisted of a health professional talk, small group discussions, and an opportunity to request assistance in obtaining a mammogram or mammogram reminder. A second cross-sectional survey was conducted to measure differences in screening rates between the study groups. Results.Participation in the intervention averaged 27%. The study groups were equivalent at baseline. At follow-up, the proportion of women age 50–79 years who reported mammography screening in the previous 15 months was significantly higher in the treatment group (64%) than in the control group (52%).

In this prospective study the personality characteristics and socioeconomic backgrounds of 216 rhinoplasty patients were evaluated. Between 1994 and 2000, a questionnaire and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) were given preoperatively to 157 females and 59 males. The MMPI was also given to age-matched people as a control. Six months after surgery, patients were called on the telephone and asked to rate their satisfaction. According to questionnaire, a great majority of the rhinoplasty patients were young, unmarried women with high education levels. In the rhinoplasty group, one or more scales of the inventory were not in the normal ranges in 45% of the patients, whereas this proportion in the control group was 28% (p < 0.01). When MMPI results are considered, female patients of this study could be described as egocentric, childish, highly active, impulsive, competitive, reactive, perfectionistic about themselves, talkative, and emotionally superficial. Male patients could be described as rigid, stubborn, over-sensitive, suspicious, perfectionistic, pessimistic, over-reactive, and having somatizations. Tension and anxiety with feelings of inferiority were found to be characteristics of the male patients. The satisfaction rate after six months was reported as 72%. There was no significant correlation between MMPI results and demographic variables, nor satisfaction rate. In conclusion, the rhinoplasty patients in our study are young people at the very beginning of their careers. It could be that their personalities and socioeconomic backgrounds combine to make aesthetic surgery rewarding enough, both socially and personally, to encourage them to follow through.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[6.384967150552256e-07, 1.1058161817345535e-06, 8.991750291897915e-06, 0.999992847442627, 3.7821388332304196e-07, 5.383091775001958e-06, 4.0010920201893896e-05, 1.0833682608790696e-06, 0.5624182820320129]"

Our aims were to increase the physical activity (PA) level in a group of Pakistani immigrant men, and to see whether any increase was associated with reduced serum glucose and insulin concentrations. The intervention was developed in collaboration with the Pakistani community. It used a social cognitive theory framework and consisted of structured supervised group exercises, group lectures, individual counselling and telephone follow-up. One- hundred and fifty physically inactive Pakistani immigrant men living in Oslo, Norway, were randomised to either a control group or an intervention group. The 5-month intervention focused on increasing levels of PA, which were assessed by use of accelerometer (Actigraph MTI 7164) recordings. Risk of diabetes was assessed by serum glucose and insulin concentrations determined in a fasted state, and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). ANCOVA was used to assess differences between groups. There was a mean difference in PA between the two groups of 49 counts per minute per day, representing a 15 % (95 % CI = 8.7–21.2; P = 0.01) higher increase in total PA level in the intervention group than in the control group. Insulin values taken 2 h after an OGTT were reduced in the intervention group by 27 % (95 % CI = 18.9–35.0; P = 0.02) more than those in the control group. There were no differences in fasting or postprandial glucose values between the groups at the follow-up test. This type of intervention can increase PA and reduce serum insulin in Pakistani immigrant men, thereby presumably reducing their risk of T2D.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9990642666816711, 0.9999992847442627, 0.0011671213433146477, 0.9250038266181946, 4.4624917450164503e-07, 0.003014314454048872, 2.527091055526398e-06, 1.1885236972375424e-06, 8.536616178389522e-07]"

59,"community mothers programme randomised controlled trial of non professional intervention in parenting OBJECTIVE--To see whether non-professional volunteer community mothers could deliver a child development programme to disadvantaged first time mothers for children aged up to 1 year. DESIGN--Randomised controlled trial. SETTING--A regional health authority in Dublin. SUBJECTS--262 first time mothers who were delivered during six months in 1989 and who lived in a deprived area of Dublin; 30 experienced mothers from the same community recruited as community mothers. INTERVENTIONS--All the first time mothers received standard support from the public health nurse. In addition, those in the intervention group received the services of a community mother, who was scheduled to visit monthly during the first year of the child9s life. RESULTS--232 (89%) first time mothers completed the study--127 in the intervention group, 105 controls. At the end of the study children in the intervention group were more likely to have received all of their primary immunisations, to be read to, and to be read to daily, played more cognitive games; and were exposed to more nursery rhymes. They were less likely to begin cows9 milk before 26 weeks and to receive an inappropriate energy intake and inappropriate amounts of animal protein, non-animal protein, wholefoods, vegetables, fruit, and milk. Mothers in the intervention group also had a better diet than controls.

61,"global oral health inequalities the view from a research funder Despite impressive worldwide improvements in oral health, inequalities in oral health status among and within countries remain a daunting public health challenge. Oral health inequalities arise from a complex web of health determinants, including social, behavioral, economic, genetic, environmental, and health system factors. Eliminating these inequalities cannot be accomplished in isolation of oral health from overall health, or without recognizing that oral health is influenced at multiple individual, family, community, and health systems levels. For several reasons, this is an opportune time for global efforts targeted at reducing oral health inequalities. Global health is increasingly viewed not just as a humanitarian obligation, but also as a vehicle for health diplomacy and part of the broader mission to reduce poverty, build stronger economies, and strengthen global security. Despite the global economic recession, there are trends that portend well for support of global health efforts: increased globalization of research and development, growing investment from private philanthropy, an absolute growth of spending in research and innovation, and an enhanced interest in global health among young people. More systematic and far-reaching efforts will be required to address oral health inequalities through the engagement of oral health funders and sponsors of research, with partners from multiple public and private sectors. The oral health community must be at the table with other health disciplines and create opportunities for eliminating inequalities through collaborations that can harness both the intellectual and financial resources of multiple sectors and institutions.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.1017718861694448e-06, 2.662996848812327e-06, 1.0289926649420522e-05, 1.198008976643905e-05, 4.443394345798879e-07, 6.185434358485509e-06, 0.999992847442627, 6.591116061827051e-07, 1.2408371730998624e-05]"
62,"facing depression with botulinum toxin a randomized controlled trial Positive effects on mood have been observed in subjects who underwent treatment of glabellar frown lines with botulinum toxin and, in an open case series, depression remitted or improved after such treatment. Using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial design we assessed botulinum toxin injection to the glabellar region as an adjunctive treatment of major depression. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to a verum (onabotulinumtoxinA, n = 15) or placebo (saline, n = 15) group. The primary end point was change in the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale six weeks after treatment compared to baseline. The verum and the placebo groups did not differ significantly in any of the collected baseline characteristics. Throughout the sixteen-week follow-up period there was a significant improvement in depressive symptoms in the verum group compared to the placebo group as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (F((6,168)) = 5.76, p < 0.001, η(2) = 0.17). Six weeks after a single treatment scores of onabotulinumtoxinA recipients were reduced on average by 47.1% and by 9.2% in placebo-treated participants (F((1,28)) = 12.30, p = 0.002, η(2) = 0.31, d = 1.28). The effect size was even larger at the end of the study (d = 1.80). Treatment-dependent clinical improvement was also reflected in the Beck Depression Inventory, and in the Clinical Global Impressions Scale. This study shows that a single treatment of the glabellar region with botulinum toxin may shortly accomplish a strong and sustained alleviation of depression in patients, who did not improve sufficiently on previous medication. It supports the concept, that the facial musculature not only expresses, but also regulates mood states.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9998801946640015, 4.725946837424999e-06, 8.576931577408686e-06, 0.9999843835830688, 3.494066049825051e-07, 5.825570042361505e-05, 7.485812716367946e-07, 2.3834832063585054e-06, 0.00023258855799213052]"
63,"maternity shelter care for adolescents its effect on incidence of low birth weight A group of 112 pregnant adolescents residing in a maternity shelter was compared with a group of 113 pregnant adolescents residing in their own homes but receiving identical medical care. The sheltered group was made up of a particularly high-risk group: they were more likely to be black, unmarried, receiving public assistance, and registered later for prenatal care than the group living at home. Despite these differences, the sheltered group delivered significantly fewer infants of low birth weight and preterm gestation than the control group. Variables assessed in this study fail to explain this difference. It is concluded that the services offered in a maternity shelter can have a positive impact on the reduction of low birth weight deliveries in a group of high-risk patients.

64,"challenges in evaluating an arthritis self management program for people with hip and knee osteoarthritis in real world clinical settings Objective. To evaluate the influence of a 6-week Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and self-management skills in clinical settings. Methods. Individuals with hip or knee osteoarthritis referred to orthopedic surgeons or rheumatologists at 6 hospitals in Victoria, Australia, were recruited. In a randomized controlled trial, participants received the Stanford ASMP and self-help book (intervention) or book only (control). Assessments included the Assessment of Quality of Life instrument (AQoL; range −0.04 to 1.00) and Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ; range 1–6) at baseline and up to 12 months. The primary outcome was HRQOL at 12 months (assessed using the AQoL). Results. Recruitment was concluded early due to persistent challenges including infrequent referrals and patient inability or disinterest in participating. Of 1125 individuals screened, only 120 were randomized (control, n = 62; intervention, n = 58). Seven ASMP were conducted while 18 scheduled ASMP were cancelled. Forty-four of 58 intervention group participants received the intervention as allocated (76%); all control group participants were sent the book (100%). Ninety-four participants (78%) completed 12-month assessments (control, 90%; intervention, 66%). There was no difference in HRQOL at 12 months (adjusted mean difference −0.02, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.05). At 6 weeks, the intervention group reported higher heiQ skill and technique acquisition scores (adjusted mean difference 0.29, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.55); however, this dissipated by 3 months. Conclusion. Significant challenges hampered this evaluation of the ASMP. The observed lack of enthusiasm from potential referrers and patients raises doubts about the practicality of this intervention in real-world settings. (ANZCTR Clinical Trials Registry no.

Recently, interest has been focused on the impact of implicit processes and measures on health-related behaviours. Dual-systems models have been proposed to provide a framework for understanding the effects of explicit or deliberative and implicit or impulsive processes on health behaviours. Informed by a dual-systems approach and self-determination theory, the aim of this study was to test the effects of implicit and explicit motivation on three health-related behaviours in a sample of undergraduate students (N = 162). Implicit motives were hypothesised to predict behaviour independent of intentions while explicit motives would be mediated by intentions.

66,"applying the theory of planned behavior to predict dairy product consumption by older adults Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to explain intention to consume dairy products and consumption of dairy products by older adults using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The factors examined were attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered. Setting: Community centers with congregate dining programs, group classes, and recreational events for older adults. Subjects: One hundred and sixty-two older adults (mean age 75 years) completed the questionnaire. Subjects were mostly women (76%) and white (65%), with about half having less than a high school education or completing high school. Variables Measured: Variables based on the TPB were assessed through questionnaire items that were constructed to form scales measuring attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention to consume dairy products. Dairy product consumption was measured using a food frequency questionnaire. Analysis: Regression analyses were used to determine the association between the scales for the 3 variables proposed in the TPB and intention to consume and consumption of dairy products; the α level was set at .05 to determine the statistical significance of results. Results: Attitudes toward eating dairy products and perceived behavioral control contributed to the model for predicting intention, whereas subjective norms did not. Attitudes toward eating dairy products were slightly more important than perceived behavioral control in predicting intention. In turn, intention was strongly related to dairy product consumption, and perceived behavioral control was independently associated with dairy product consumption. Conclusions and Implications: These results suggest the utility of the TPB in explaining dairy product consumption for older adults. Nutrition education should focus on improving attitudes and removing barriers to consumption of dairy products for older adults.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9977287650108337, 0.99936443567276, 0.018635261803865433, 0.14566633105278015, 3.4983239061148197e-07, 0.9999977350234985, 5.100072485220153e-06, 1.0018383136412012e-06, 9.742911970533896e-07]"
67,"promoting breast feeding in a deprived area the influence of a peer support initiative The present article describes a qualitative study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-support intervention to promote breast-feeding in a deprived area. The aims of the study were to: explore stakeholders experiences of the intervention; explore the development of a culture of breast-feeding; and consider the potential of the initiative for building community capacity. The methods used in the research were in-depth interviews, diaries and direct observation. The findings describe the social and cultural barriers to breast-feeding experienced by women, and the ways in which professional and lay participants in the peer-support project attempt to reduce them. The advantages of partnership working between health professionals and lay volunteers are then explored. These include: sharing the workload; providing an informal tier of support to mothers; and importantly, offering support and advice stemming from personal experience. For lay supporters, the benefits of taking part in the project range from personal satisfaction at being recognised as skilled, to gains in confidence which potentially open up further educational and training opportunities. In conclusion, it is suggested that the success of such interventions is unlikely to be captured solely by monitoring breast-feeding rates, but needs to take into account the wider context of community development.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999057054519653, 3.373510935489321e-06, 1.3212385965744033e-05, 2.7304429750074632e-05, 3.6009797099723073e-07, 1.6988087736535817e-06, 0.999998927116394, 9.235697575604718e-07, 5.94435903167323e-07]"

A cluster randomized design with 12 housing sites as the primary sampling units was used: 6 sites were assigned to a Peer-led plus Screening Access (PL) condition, and 6 were assigned to Screening Access only (SCR) condition. Study-related outcomes were CRC screening, physical activity (measured as mean steps/day), and multivitamin use.

69,"fruit and vegetable consumption nutritional knowledge and beliefs in mothers and children Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is an important health behaviour. Parental and other psychosocial influences on children s fruit and vegetable consumption are poorly understood. The contribution of a variety of psychosocial and environmental factors to consumption of fruit and vegetables by children aged 9-11 years was explored. Ninety-two mothers and children (48 girls and 44 boys) were recruited via urban primary health-care practices. Socio-economic and educational level, nutritional knowledge and health- and diet-related beliefs and attitudes were assessed in mothers and children by questionnaires and semistructured interviews. Mothers diets were measured by a food frequency questionnaire, while children s diets were assessed by 3-day diaries (N = 80). The pattern of influence of the various measures on fruit and vegetable consumption was compared with that on children s confectionery intake. The children s intakes of macronutrients were typical for the U.K. (37% fat, 50% carbohydrate and 13% protein by energy; 12 g/day fibre), while median fruit, fruit juice and vegetable intake amounted to about 2.5 servings/day. Univariate correlations and subsequent multiple regression analyses revealed quite different influences on the three food types. Independent predictors of children s fruit intake included mothers nutritional knowledge (beta = 0.37), mothers frequency of fruit consumption (beta = 0.30) and mothers attitudinal conviction that increasing fruit and vegetable consumption by their children could reduce their risk of developing cancer (beta = 0.27; multiple beta = 0.37, p<0.0001). Children s vegetable consumption was independently explained by the child s liking for commonly eaten vegetables (beta = 0.36) and the mother s belief in the importance of disease prevention when choosing her child s food (beta = - 0.27; r(2) = 0.20, p<0.001). Children s confectionery consumption was predicted by the mother s liking for confectionery (beta=0.32) and the children s concern for health in choosing what to eat (beta =-0.26, r(2) = 0.16, p<0.005). Children s consumption of fruit and vegetables are related to different psychosocial and environmental factors.

For 1180 white males, a variant of the Cox regression model is employed to estimate the direct and interaction effects of economic status on survivorship, controlling for age at diagnosis, stage, severity of disease, and initial course of treatment. The results do not show a strong relationship. Estimates of direct or main economic effects rarely reach even borderline statistical significance; they are highly sensitive to model specification and the measurement of the economic variable. An equally weak interaction effect between economic status and stage is detected in several cases, but the parameter estimates are unstable. Such measurement and specification errors have probably exaggerated the importance of economic factors in cancer survival in earlier investigations.","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[6.062346642465855e-07, 0.9994465708732605, 3.0384762794710696e-05, 4.872157205682015e-06, 3.838391933186358e-07, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9999971389770508, 6.00076475620881e-07, 1.0626966968629858e-06]"

This study examined the long-term efficacy of 2 computer-tailored physical activity interventions for older adults and its psychosocial and environmental mediators. Methods: A clustered randomized controlled trial (N = 1,971) was conducted that included 3 research arms: (a) basic computer-tailored print intervention, targeting psychosocial mediators; (b) environmentally computer-tailored print intervention, targeting psychosocial and environmental mediators; and (c) no-intervention control group. Interventions were developed using the intervention mapping approach and consisted of 3 computer-tailored letters delivered over 4 months. Questionnaires assessed the study outcomes (i.e., total weekly days and total weekly minutes of physical activity) at baseline and 12 months. Potential mediators (i.e., awareness, attitude, self-efficacy, intention, social influence, intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and perceived environment) were assessed at baseline and at 3 or 6 months. Results: Multilevel regression analyses revealed that both interventions significantly changed total weekly days of physical activity compared with the control group, but only the environmentally computer-tailored print intervention significantly changed weekly minutes of physical activity. Multiple mediation models showed that the effects of both interventions on weekly days of physical activity were mediated by changes in awareness and intention. Conclusions: Computer-tailored interventions were effective in inducing long-term behavioral changes in physical activity behavior of older adults.

North Glasgow was selected as the locale because it contains the areas with Scotland s lowest and highest fruit and vegetable intakes. The impact of socioeconomic status upon the children s perceptions and preferences was examined, as were age, gender and frequency of vegetable consumption. The repertory grid method was used to elicit the perceptual data. Personal attributes were scored on a 10-cm linear scale, alongside a scale to measure the children s liking for the vegetables. Generalized Procrustes analysis and Preference Mapping were used to analyze the data.

Participants were 808 Latino parents and their children enrolled in kindergarten through 2nd grade. Measures included parent and child body mass index (BMI) and a self-administered parent survey that assessed several parent and child behaviors. There were no significant intervention effects on children’s BMI z-score. The family intervention changed several obesity-related child behaviors (e.g., fruit/vegetable consumption) and these were mediated by changes in parenting variables (e.g., parent monitoring).

77,"impact of a randomized campus community trial to prevent high risk drinking among college students BACKGROUND: High-risk drinking by college students continues to pose a significant threat to public health. Despite increasing evidence of the contribution of community-level and campus-level environmental factors to high-risk drinking, there have been few rigorous tests of interventions that focus on changing these interlinked environments. The Study to Prevent Alcohol Related Consequences (SPARC) assessed the efficacy of a comprehensive intervention using a community organizing approach to implement environmental strategies in and around college campuses. The goal of SPARC was to reduce high-risk drinking and alcohol-related consequences among college students. METHODS: Ten universities in North Carolina were randomized to an Intervention or Comparison condition. Each Intervention school was assigned a campus/community organizer. The organizer worked to form a campus-community coalition, which developed and implemented a strategic plan to use environmental strategies to reduce high-risk drinking and its consequences. The intervention was implemented over a period of 3 years. Primary outcome measures were assessed using a web-based survey of students. Measures of high-risk drinking included number of days alcohol was consumed, number of days of binge drinking, and greatest number of drinks consumed (all in the past 30 days); and number of days one gets drunk in a typical week. Measures of alcohol-related consequences included indices of moderate consequences due to one s own drinking, severe consequences due to one s own drinking, interpersonal consequences due to others drinking, and community consequences due to others drinking (all using a past 30-day time frame). Measure of alcohol-related injuries included (i) experiencing alcohol-related injuries and (ii) alcohol-related injuries caused to others. RESULTS: We found significant decreases in the Intervention group compared with the Comparison group in severe consequences due to students own drinking and alcohol-related injuries caused to others. In secondary analyses, higher levels of implementation of the intervention were associated with reductions in interpersonal consequences due to others drinking and alcohol-related injuries caused to others. CONCLUSIONS: A community organizing approach promoting implementation of environmental interventions can significantly affect high-risk drinking and its consequences among college students.

78,"pregnancy and the maintenance of self identity implications for antenatal care in the community It is widely acknowledged that many women prefer to receive their antenatal care in the community. This paper explores one explanation for why this may be the case. The paper is based on a qualitative study of 19 primagravidae, aged between 16 and 30 years, who were interviewed using the technique of repeated in-depth interviewing. The aim of the research was to explore the relationship between women s experiences of pregnancy and the maintenance of self-identity during this time. The research findings indicate that the relationship between the midwife and her antenatal patient can foster both a sense of similarity to others and a sense of personal uniqueness, which appear essential to the maintenance of self-identity during pregnancy. Good communication seems to be an essential tool for the community midwife, as it allows patients to normalise their experiences and yet feel that their experiences of pregnancy are unique. The findings indicate that continuity of care may be important in fostering a sense of similarity to others and that continuity of carer may be required to ensure uniqueness.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9997456669807434, 0.9998733997344971, 0.008599012158811092, 0.9996864795684814, 4.09476683671528e-07, 2.066299202851951e-06, 0.19325676560401917, 1.4336957292471197e-06, 1.8147281934943749e-06]"

81,"living alongside hazardous factories risk choice and necessity A questionnaire survey conducted in Mardyck, a small town in northern France, surrounded by hazardous Seveso plants provided an opportunity to test various models which explained why individuals lived in these risk areas. In this article, we examine which of three different approaches: economic pressures and inequalities, biased risk perception, and good reasons best explained individual decisions to live in this hazardous area. We found that none of these three approaches fully accounted for past and present decisions but the good reasons approach enabled us to explore individual reasoning most effectively. While our findings indicated that individuals who live in the Mardyck area are subject to economic and social constraints as well as cognitive and cultural biases (distorting risk perception), they had made a conscious choice to move to and stay in Mardyck. They had good reasons to live in Mardyck; they could afford to live in attractive area with good community facilities. Thus, their decisions were rational, albeit their rationality was bounded or restricted. Having made the decision, some residents dealt with the cognitive dissonance of living in a dangerous area by disregarding or denying the dangers, others, a worried minority, dealt with this same dissonance by highlighting their good reasons , that is, the ways the benefits of living in Mardyck outweighted the possibility of a catastrophic event.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9973894953727722, 2.5890008146234322e-06, 3.269441003794782e-05, 4.5022602535027545e-06, 3.8163273075042525e-07, 5.128409611643292e-06, 0.9991937279701233, 1.3428618785837898e-06, 4.32662045568577e-06]"

84,"a randomized study of tracking with outreach and provider prompting to improve immunization coverage and primary care Objective. To compare and measure the effects and cost-effectiveness of two interventions designed to raise immunization rates. Settings. Nine primary care sites serving impoverished and middle-class children. Subjects. Complete birth cohorts (ages 0 to 12 months; n = 3015) from these sites. Interventions. Two 18-month duration interventions: 1) tracking with outreach [tracking/outreach] to bring underimmunized children to their primary care provider office, and 2) a primary care provider office policy change to identify and reduce missed immunization opportunities (prompting). Design. Randomized, controlled trial, randomizing within sites using a two-by-two factorial design. Subjects were allocated to one of four study groups: control, prompting only, tracking/outreach only, and combined prompting with tracking/outreach. Outcomes were obtained by blinded chart abstraction. Measures. Immunization status for age; number of days of delay in immunization; primary care utilization; and rates of screening for occult disease. Results. Out of 3015 subjects, 274 subjects (9%) transferred out of the participating sites or had incomplete charts and were excluded. The 2741 (91%) remaining subjects were assessed. At baseline, study groups did not differ in age, gender, insurance type, or immunization status. Of the remaining subjects, 63% received Medicaid. Final series-complete immunization coverage levels were: control, 74%; prompting-only, 76%; tracking/outreach-only 95%; and combined tracking/outreach with prompting, 95%. Analysis of variance showed that: 1) tracking/outreach increased immunization rates 20 percentage points; 2) tracking/outreach decreased mean immunization delay 63 days; 3) tracking/outreach increased mean health supervision visits 0.44 visits per child; 4) tracking/outreach increased mean anemia screening 0.17 screenings per child and mean lead screenings 0.12 screenings per child; 5) impact of tracking/outreach was greatest for uninsured and impoverished patients; and 6) the prompting intervention had no impact on the studied outcomes, and its failure was caused by inconsistent use of prompts and failure to vaccinate ill children when prompted. Using tracking/outreach, the cost per additional child fully immunized was $474. Each $1000 spent on the tracking/outreach intervention resulted in: 2.1 additional fully vaccinated children and 668 fewer child-days of delayed immunization; 4.6 additional health supervision visits and 5.9 additional other visits to the primary care provider; and 1.8 additional anemia screenings and 1.3 additional lead screenings. Conclusions. Outreach directed toward children not up-to-date on immunizations improves not only immunization status, but also health supervision visit attendance and screening rates. The cost per additional child immunized was high, but should be interpreted in view of the spillover benefits that accompanied improved immunization. Effective means to improve coverage by reducing missed immunization opportunities still need to be identified. immunization, primary care, randomized, controlled trial, missed immunization opportunities, outreach.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[8.993001756607555e-07, 0.9999973773956299, 0.0002691474510356784, 1.8608236132422462e-05, 3.462569679868466e-07, 9.409573976881802e-06, 0.9999991655349731, 1.3076451068627648e-06, 0.8140370845794678]"
85,"positive messaging promotes walking in older adults Walking is among the most cost-effective and accessible means of exercise. Mounting evidence suggests that walking may help to maintain physical and cognitive independence in old age by preventing a variety of health problems. However, older Americans fall far short of meeting the daily recommendations for walking. In 2 studies, we examined whether considering older adults preferential attention to positive information may effectively enhance interventions aimed at promoting walking. In Study 1, we compared the effectiveness of positive, negative, and neutral messages to encourage walking (as measured with pedometers). Older adults who were informed about the benefits of walking walked more than those who were informed about the negative consequences of failing to walk, whereas younger adults were unaffected by framing valence. In Study 2, we examined within-person change in walking in older adults in response to positively- or negatively-framed messages over a 28-day period. Once again, positively-framed messages more effectively promoted walking than negatively-framed messages, and the effect was sustained across the intervention period. Together, these studies suggest that consideration of age-related changes in preferences for positive and negative information may inform the design of effective interventions to promote healthy lifestyles.

86,"the male cosmetic surgery patient a matched sample gender analysis of elective cosmetic surgery and cosmetic dentistry patients Abstract: Plastic surgeons have traditionally perceived male patients as more psychologically disturbed than female patients. This study employed a matched sample design to explore the psychosocial experiences of 50 male and 50 female elective cosmetic surgery and cosmetic dentistry patients. It also aimed to compare male and female patients on preoperative psychosocial dysfunction on standardized measures (psychiatric disturbance, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, dysmorphic concern, and low body image) and postoperative dissatisfaction. The findings revealed that there were many similarities between the self-reported appearance concerns, motivations for surgery, and expectations of surgery between male and female patients. Although male patients did not report higher levels of preoperative psychosocial dysfunction than their female counterparts, they were more likely to report postoperative dissatisfaction. Preoperative screening is recommended to identify the minority of male patients who will report an unsatisfactory outcome despite a technically good result.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[5.091088723929715e-07, 1.0501555607334012e-06, 3.3221731428056955e-05, 0.9999924898147583, 3.89325720107081e-07, 2.0165921341686044e-06, 7.006149758126412e-07, 7.534932819908136e-07, 0.9999982118606567]"

88,"birth outcomes for teenage women in new south wales 1998 2003 Background: Pregnancy and childbirth in teenage women are associated with obstetric and social risks, and there is evidence that the birth rate among teenagers in rural and remote areas of Australia is not in decline. The combination of non-urban residence and young age at delivery might define a subgroup of women at special risk of adverse birth outcomes. Aims: To compare birth outcomes of New South Wales (NSW) teenagers residing in rural and remote areas with those living in larger centres with greater access to services. Methods: Outcomes for all singleton deliveries to teenage women living in NSW during the period 1998–2003 were reviewed. The women s place of residence was assigned an ARIA (Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia) classification according to remoteness and access to services. Analysis included obstetric factors (such as parity), and smoking status. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken to examine the impact of maternal factors on obstetric outcomes. Results: During the study period, 21 880 teenage women had singleton deliveries. Babies of teenage mothers in very remote areas had higher rates of preterm birth, small-for-gestational age and stillbirth. Rates of smoking were higher in more remote areas, and smoking correlated with preterm birth and stillbirth. Conclusions: Teenagers living in remote areas of NSW face a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than their urban cousins.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999872446060181, 1.3796714029012946e-06, 7.023033504083287e-06, 1.544309634482488e-05, 3.5544209708859853e-07, 2.1026828562753508e-06, 0.00010827636288013309, 5.924488277742057e-07, 1.1176514362887247e-06]"

91,"the effects of nicotine gum and counseling among african american light smokers a 2 2 factorial design Aim Approximately 50% of African American smokers are light smokers (smoke ≤ 10 cigarettes a day). The prevalence of light smoking in the United States is increasing, yet there has not been a single smoking cessation clinical trial targeting light smokers. The purpose of this 2 × 2 factorial, randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of nicotine gum (2 mg versus placebo) and counseling (motivational interviewing versus health education) for African American light smokers. Design Participants were assigned randomly to one of four study arms: 2 mg nicotine gum plus health education (HE); 2 mg nicotine gum plus motivational interviewing (MI); placebo gum plus HE; and placebo gum plus MI. Participants and setting A total of 755 African American light smokers (66% female, mean age = 45) were enrolled at a community health center over a 16-month period. Intervention and measurements Participants received an 8-week supply of nicotine gum and six counseling sessions during the course of the 26-week study. Biochemical measures included expired carbon monoxide (CO) and serum and salivary cotinine. Findings Seven-day quit rates for nicotine gum were no better than for the placebo group (14.2% versus 11.1%, P = 0.232) at 6 months. However, a counseling effect emerged, with HE performing significantly better than MI (16.7% versus 8.5%, P < 0.001). These results were consistent across outcome time-points (weeks 1, 8, and 26). Conclusions Results highlight the potential positive impact of directive information and advice-oriented counseling on smoking cessation. Studies are needed to assess other interventions that may further improve quit rates among African American light smokers who are motivated to quit.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[3.0303222047223244e-06, 0.9999979734420776, 2.4823360945447348e-05, 2.781179136945866e-05, 3.390417191440065e-07, 0.9999958276748657, 9.441062502446584e-06, 8.446388051197573e-07, 5.675799457094399e-07]"

96,"gender differences in conference presentations a consequence of self selection Women continue to be under-represented in the sciences, with their representation declining at each progressive academic level. These differences persist despite long-running policies to ameliorate gender inequity. We compared gender differences in exposure and visibility at an evolutionary biology conference for attendees at two different academic levels: student and post-PhD academic. Despite there being almost exactly a 1:1 ratio of women and men attending the conference, we found that when considering only those who presented talks, women spoke for far less time than men of an equivalent academic level: on average student women presented for 23% less time than student men, and academic women presented for 17% less time than academic men. We conducted more detailed analyses to tease apart whether this gender difference was caused by decisions made by the attendees or through bias in evaluation of the abstracts. At both academic levels, women and men were equally likely to request a presentation. However, women were more likely than men to prefer a short talk, regardless of academic level. We discuss potential underlying reasons for this gender bias, and provide recommendations to avoid similar gender biases at future conferences.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[6.355556934067863e-07, 1.063198510564689e-06, 1.4845401892671362e-05, 0.999992847442627, 4.5751048105557857e-07, 1.4780497394895065e-06, 1.090373075385287e-06, 7.284207867996884e-07, 6.431130827877496e-07]"
97,"second births to teenage mothers risk factors for low birth weight and preterm birth CONTEXT: Teenagers are more likely than older women to have a low-birth-weight infant or a preterm birth, and the risks may be particularly high when they have a second birth. Identifying predictors of these outcomes in second teenage births is essential for developing preventive strategies. METHODS: Birth certificate data for 1993–2002 were linked to identify second births to Milwaukee teenagers. Predictors of having a low-birth-weight second infant or a preterm second birth were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: The same proportion of first and second infants were low-birth-weight (12%), but second births were more likely than first births to be preterm (15% vs. 12%). In analyses that adjusted for demographic, pregnancy and behavioral characteristics, the odds that a second infant was low-birth-weight or preterm were elevated if the mother smoked during pregnancy (odds ratios, 2.2 and 1.9, respectively), had inadequate prenatal weight gain (1.8 and 1.4), had an interpregnancy interval of less than 18 months (1.6–2.9 and 1.4–2.3) or was black (2.7 and 1.7). Women who had received an adequate level of prenatal care had reduced odds of both outcomes (0.6 and 0.4). Women younger than 16 also had increased odds of having a low-birth-weight second infant. Further adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics yielded largely the same results. In addition, women who were unmarried or did not identify a father were at increased risk of both outcomes (1.5 for each), and poor women were at risk of having a low-birth-weight infant (1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of poor birth outcomes include modifiable behaviors. Prenatal interventions addressing these behaviors could help improve outcomes.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[8.732275205147744e-07, 2.6673890261008637e-06, 1.0093596756632905e-05, 5.316674105415586e-06, 4.953751044922683e-07, 5.7895613281289116e-06, 0.9999977350234985, 4.13311397551297e-07, 0.00015757398796267807]"
98,"evaluation of an osteoporosis and fall risk intervention program for community dwelling elderly a quasi experimental study of behavioral modifications Background and aims: Osteoporosis and fall fractures are increasing problems amongst the elderly. The aim of this study was to explore whether combined population-based and individual interventions directed at risk factors for osteoporosis and falls result in behavioral changes in an elderly population. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used for the study. Persons aged ≥65 years were randomly selected in the intervention and control community. An intervention program was managed from the primary health care center and delivered to the community. Health education was designed to increase awareness of risk factors for the development of osteoporosis and falling. Questionnaires about lifestyle, health, previous fractures, safety behavior and physical activity level were distributed at baseline in 1989 and at the follow-ups in 1992 and 1994 in both communities. Results: There was a difference of 17.7% between the dual intervention (receiving both population-based and individual interventions) and the control samples regarding the self-reported use of shoe/cane spikes, and a difference of 20.5% regarding the reported “moderate level” of physical activity in 1994. There was an increase in the number of participants in the dual intervention sample who, at baseline, had not reported equipping their homes with non-slip mats and removing loose rugs but who did report these changes in 1994. The increase in the reported use of shoe/cane spikes in the dual intervention sample was observed mainly for the period 1992–1994. Conclusions: A public health intervention model, including both population-based and individual inter- ventions, can contribute to behavioral changes in the prevention of falls and changed physical activity patterns amongst elderly people.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[1.3806663901050342e-06, 1.1851891486003296e-06, 9.413368388777599e-05, 0.999990701675415, 3.3858157166832825e-07, 0.999997615814209, 1.1886619404322118e-06, 8.833455922285793e-07, 5.974360988147964e-07]"
99,"can a nurse directed intervention reduce the exposure of patients with knee osteoarthritis to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to evaluate a nurse-directed self-management intervention for managed care patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), emphasizing nonpharmacologic (NonPharm) management of pain and functional impairments and minimization of exposure to the risks and costs of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS : Subjects were 186 patients from a large health maintenance organization (HMO) who satisfied American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for knee OA. Two of 4 HMO sites (and their patient cohorts) were randomly assigned to the education group; the other 2 served as a delayed-intervention control group. At each location of care for the education group, an arthritis nurse educator, in consultation with the patient s primary care physician (PCP), followed a detailed algorithm for implementing and monitoring the response to NonPharm treatment modalities (eg, quadriceps strengthening exercises, counseling in principles of joint protection, use of thermal modalities). The nurses apprised the PCP of the patient s progress and made algorithm-based recommendations, as appropriate, for reduction of dose, and eventual discontinuation, of NSAIDs in favor of acetaminophen. Outcomes (measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months) included pain and function scales from the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA Index. RESULTS : The treatment groups were similar at baseline with respect to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Medical record audits revealed that NonPharm treatments (most often exercise) were implemented by 75% of patients in the education group but by only 18% of patients receiving routine care (P < 0.00001). Over the subsequent 12 months, 20 patients (26%) in the education group, but only 3 (5%) in the control group (P = 0.002), underwent changes in drug treatment of OA pain consistent with the NSAID-sparing goals of the intervention, ie, acetaminophen as initial drug of choice; reduction in dose, or discontinuation, of NSAID; switch from an NSAID to an analgesic. Only one patient in the education group required reinstitution of NSAIDs because of an increase in knee pain. Mean WOMAC scores indicated no deterioration of pain control or function over 12 months in the group treated according to the algorithm. CONCLUSION : Incorporation into the primary care setting of self-care education for patients with knee OA, with collaboration between a proactive arthritis nurse and the patient s PCP, can reduce reliance on NSAIDs without a resultant increase in OA pain and disability.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9967643022537231, 0.9998749494552612, 1.4772670510865282e-05, 0.999992847442627, 3.4909220403278596e-07, 0.9969899654388428, 8.294640565509326e-07, 0.005776599980890751, 1.4949833939681412e-06]"
100,"cancer survival disparities by race ethnicity and socioeconomic status in new jersey We investigated racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in cancer survival and assessed if racial disparities can be explained by socioeconomic status (SES) using New Jersey State Cancer Registry data. We included cancer cases diagnosed during 1986-1999 (n=471,939). Hazard ratios were calculated for all cancers combined and female breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers by race/ethnicity and SES for cases diagnosed in 1993-1999. Survival rates were compared for diagnosis years 1986-1992 and 1993-1999. We observed worse survival in Black patients and a SES gradient in the risk of cancer death after adjusting for age and stage at diagnosis. Following adjustment by SES, the higher risks of cancer death for Blacks were attenuated for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer and became non-significant for lung cancer. Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival can be partially explained by SES. Cancer survival rates improved significantly from 1986-1992 to 1993-1999 except for women in the poorest areas.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[6.207898195498274e-07, 7.2273746809514705e-06, 0.05391651391983032, 5.378468813432846e-06, 3.5153971111867577e-07, 3.0471560421574395e-06, 0.999998927116394, 4.438947485141398e-07, 5.885648306502844e-07]"

METHODS: This prospective case series assessed children younger than 5 years admitted to four pediatric burn centers. Each child s family completed the American Burn Association/Shriners Hospitals for Children Burn Outcome Questionnaire (BOQ), a validated and reliable assessment tool, which measures the physical and psychosocial functioning of the child with burn injury ages 0 year to 5 years, at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after discharge. Multivariate models controlling for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were developed, and recovery curves were generated for the time since burn using generalized estimating equations with random effects. RESULTS: A cohort of 438 patients was followed up prospectively. Mean (SD) patient age was 2.2 (1.2) years, mean (SD) total body surface area (TBSA) was 28% (22.4%), and 19% had inhalation injury.

Standardized measures of health status and use were administered to 633 adolescents in grades 7-12 who resided in one rural western Maryland county. Although only 6.5% (n = 41) of the sample indicated a willingness to change their regular source of care to an SBHC, greater numbers of adolescents reported a willingness to use SBHC services, with 18%, 38%, 25%, and 16%, indicating interest in routine, acute medical, miscellaneous, and reproductive health care services, respectively. Logistic regression analysis found those adolescents who reported eligibility for free-reduced lunch and no regular source of care for illness were 3.3 and 5.4 times more likely, respectively, to use an SBHC as a primary care site than those unwilling to change their source of care. Data suggest that initially many rural adolescents appear unwilling to change their primary care site to an SBHC, but do express a willingness to use offered services.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999990463256836, 0.9987462759017944, 8.877828804543242e-06, 5.876663635717705e-06, 1.4623270772062824e-06, 3.5391699384490494e-06, 0.9938609600067139, 6.36885090443684e-07, 2.7923938432650175e-06]"

To address social inequality in survival after lung cancer, it is important to consider how socioeconomic position (SEP) influences prognosis. We investigated whether SEP influenced receipt of first-line treatment and whether socioeconomic differences in survival could be explained by differences in stage, treatment and comorbidity.Material and methods. In the Danish Lung Cancer Register, we identified 13 045 patients with lung cancer diagnosed in 2004–2010, with information on stage, histology, performance status and first-line treatment. We obtained age, gender, vital status, comorbid conditions and socioeconomic information (education, income and cohabitation status) from nationwide population-based registers.

Participant characteristics, treatment modalities and clinical outcomes (HbA1c, severe hypoglycaemia [SH] and diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) as well as frequencies of attaining HbA1c goals in line with the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (<7.5% [<58 mmol/mol]) and ADA (<8.5% [<69 mmol/mol]) were compared. Insulin pump use was more frequent (74% vs 50%, p < 0.001) and HbA1c levels lower in the Prospective Diabetes Follow-up Registry (DPV) than in the T1D Exchange (T1DX) (mean 7.4% vs 8.2%, p < 0.001). A lower HbA1c level was seen in the DPV compared with the T1DX for both pump users (p < 0.001) and injection users (p < 0.001). More children from DPV were meeting the recommended HbA1c goals, compared with children from T1DX (HbA1c <7.5%: 56% vs 22%, p < 0.001; HbA1c <8.5%: 90% vs 66%, p < 0.001). The adjusted odds of having an HbA1c level <7.5% or <8.5% were 4.2 (p < 0.001) and 3.6 (p < 0.001) higher for the DPV than the T1DX, respectively. The frequency of SH did not differ between registries or by HbA1c, whereas the frequency of DKA was higher for the T1DX and greater in those with higher HbA1c levels. DPV data indicate that an HbA1c of <7.5% can frequently be achieved in children with type 1 diabetes who are under 6 years old. An improved metabolic control of type 1 diabetes in young patients appears to decrease the risk of DKA without increasing SH. The greater frequency of suboptimal control in young patients in the T1DX compared with the DPV is not fully explained by a less frequent use of insulin pumps and may relate to the higher HbA1c targets that are recommended for this age group in the USA.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 0.9971358776092529, 3.204348104191013e-05, 0.9999858140945435, 3.3254681852668e-07, 0.9742814302444458, 0.9540321230888367, 7.025291779427789e-07, 5.367244284570916e-07]"

110,"evaluation of hawaii s healthy start program Hawaii’s Healthy Start Program (HSP) is designed to prevent child abuse and neglect and to promote child health and development in newborns of families at risk for poor child outcomes. The program operates statewide in Hawaii and has inspired national and international adaptations, including Healthy Families America. This article describes HSP, its ongoing evaluation study, and evaluation findings at the end of two of a planned three years of family program participation and follow-up. After two years of service provision to families, HSP was successful in linking families with pediatric medical care, improving maternal parenting efficacy, decreasing maternal parenting stress, promoting the use of nonviolent discipline, and decreasing injuries resulting from partner violence in the home. No overall positive program impact emerged after two years of service in terms of the adequacy of well-child health care; maternal life skills, mental health, social support, or substance use; child development; the child’s home learning environment or parent-child interaction; pediatric health care use for illness or injury; or child maltreatment (according to maternal reports and child protective services reports). However, there were agency-specific positive program effects on several outcomes, including parent-child interaction, child development, maternal confidence in adult relationships, and partner violence. Significant differences were found in program implementation between the three administering agencies included in the evaluation. These differences had implications for family participation and involvement levels and, possibly, for outcomes achieved.

113,"sti prevention and the male sex industry in london evaluating a pilot peer education programme Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot peer education STI prevention programme with male sex workers. Design: A process and outcome evaluation of the pilot programme undertaken in three London male escort agencies, using a quasi-experimental design. Subjects: Workers in three London escort agencies, including 88 who completed a questionnaire, five peer educators, and a further 16 men (including management) working in two of these agencies. Methods: A peer education STI prevention programme run by the Working Men Project (WMP), a specialist sexual health service for male sex workers, was piloted in two London escort agencies. Five male sex workers participated in a 2 day peer education training programme. They then returned to their respective agencies to disseminate information and condoms, in an attempt to influence norms of behaviour. An outcome evaluation aimed to assess changes in STI related knowledge, high risk sexual behaviour, and attendance at a sexual health service. A pre-intervention questionnaire assessing variables such as STI related knowledge, sexual behaviour, and demographic information was administered in both agency A and agency B and a third agency, C, which acted as a control. Ten weeks after the peer educators returned to their agencies, the same questionnaire was administered in the same agencies. Peer educator referrals to the WMP were also recorded over this time period. The process evaluation involved interviews and focus groups with peer educators, and the completion of diaries about their experiences in the role. A further 16 men working in the agencies (including managers and an owner) were interviewed about their experience of the programme. Participant observation was also undertaken through regular outreach work to the agencies. Results: 57 men completed the questionnaire at time 1 and 44 at time 2. Unfortunately, only 13 of these were matched, precluding any meaningful analysis of change in STI related knowledge and sexual behaviour. The questionnaire provided a profile of the men working in the agencies. Of the 88 men who completed the questionnaire at least once, the majority were homosexual, and in their late teens/early 20s. Most were of a white ethnic group, though there was some range within these categories. Most preferred to speak English and education levels were high. Relative STI knowledge revealed a high understanding of HIV and hepatitis B, moderate understanding of gonorrhoea, syphilis, genital warts and herpes, and little knowledge of non-specific urethritis (NSU) or chlamydia. Sexual behaviour suggested a highly sexually active population with both male and female paying and non-paying partners. Condom use was highest for paying partners, particularly for anal sex. Condom use for oral sex with all partners was less consistent, and condom use for all types of sex with regular partners was lower than with other partners. The small number of men engaging in vaginal sex with paying and regular partners were less likely to use condoms. 26 new patients registered at the WMP as a result of peer educator referrals, representing 65% of all new contacts over the study period. The process evaluation revealed that while the training programme was considered adequate and while peer educators felt the programme and their roles to be a success, their experience of the role was difficult. The role of management support was crucial in supporting the programme. The assumption that peers are particularly effective educators was not borne out by the results. While peers were considered suitable to discuss some aspects of the industry, many preferred to consult professionals about health related matters. The concept of peers was problematic with most of the men drawing peers from subgroups within the agencies. Other constraints on behaviour such as a lack of power, particularly with regard to a lack of management support, or poverty, had a substantial impact on behaviour which were not influenced by the peer educators. Conclusions: The study illustrated the difficulties of utilising quasi-experimental evaluation methodology with this client group. It also demonstrated the limitations of peer education based on information provision health education models which focus on individual behaviour change.

114,"pediatric emergency department based rapid hiv testing adolescent attitudes and preferences Objective: The objective of this study was to describe adolescent attitudes/preferences toward rapid HIV testing in a pediatric emergency department (PED). Methods: An anonymous survey was completed by adolescents who presented to an urban PED. The survey was completed while they participated in a rapid HIV prevention/testing program. Survey questions included demographics, HIV risk factors/knowledge, prior testing experience, and attitudes/preferences toward rapid HIV testing. Results: One hundred fourteen adolescents between the ages of 14 and 21 years were surveyed. Most respondents (69%) reported that the emergency department was a very high preference location for testing. Eighty percent of adolescents agreed that they were more likely to get tested for HIV if a rapid test was available. Most participants strongly agreed that it was important to receive pretest and posttest counseling for HIV In addition, 38% strongly agreed that they preferred a same-sex counselor, whereas 9% strongly agreed that they preferred a same-ethnicity counselor. Eighty-one percent reported that they planned to get retested for HIV in the next 6 to 12 months. Conclusions: This study offers valuable new insights into adolescent attitudes and preferences for rapid HIV testing in a PED. Adolescents gave high ratings to the location, testing, and counseling process. Our data support the importance of structured counseling, which is contrary to current published perspectives of counseling efficacy. In addition, we found that the PED was a highly preferred location for rapid HIV testing, which supports the need for increased development of prevention and testing programs in this setting.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[8.502573223267973e-07, 0.43677330017089844, 1.3742645933234598e-05, 4.545080810203217e-05, 0.9999949932098389, 3.2462335184391122e-06, 0.9985772371292114, 6.60322086787346e-07, 0.9999985694885254]"
115,"gender differences in experiences of k awardees beyond space resources and science The thought-provoking article by Dr. Holliday and colleagues highlights gender differences among recipients of K awards. Even though these awards include provisions for protected time and resources, a higher proportion of women awardees reported inadequate access to “soft” resources, notably grant administrators and statistical support. The authors suggest that the root cause of this discrepancy may be that women are disadvantaged in the informal negotiations necessary to achieve these less structured resources, either due to an inadequate or less effective skill set, or due to unconscious bias by those with whom they negotiate. The authors further imply that inadequacy of research support may underlie gender discrepancies in publication productivity and securing research funding, and that academic productivity may be inhibited by unfair treatment. Strengths of the study include the robust survey response rate (75 %), the number of awardees studied (1,708), and the statistical methodology that controlled for confounders, including academic rank. Holliday and colleagues’ findings reinforce many of the conclusions from the National Academies’ landmark report, Beyond Bias and Barriers,1 which drew attention to similar factors that can adversely impact women’s careers in biomedical sciences. Beyond Bias and Barriers specifically noted access to resources, as well as personal and professional development (e.g., negotiation skills), as contributing factors to the attrition of women from careers in science and academia. Other factors included in the report were mentorship/sponsorship, and the challenges of balancing career and family responsibilities. Though Beyond Bias and Barriers was published nine years ago, the Holliday article makes it clear that these issues still remain significant today. Holliday et al. also draws to our attention the effect of the implicit (unconscious) biases that are common in the workplace, as well as sex stereotype threat. As articles by Carnes et al.2 and Easterly and Ricard3 point out, these biases lead to micro-inequities that, especially for women, can erode academic success over time and discourage women in academic medical careers, and that both are important contributors to the attrition of women from academics. Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)’s recently released report entitled The State of Women in Academic Medicine (https://www.aamc.org/data/databook/tables/accessed November 10, 2014) demonstrate that the pipeline has long been flush with women who have the appropriate terminal degrees to enter careers in academic medicine. Yet their data also show that women currently make up a little more than one-third (38 %) of full-time academic medicine faculty. Under-representation persists for full-time women assistant, associate and full professors (44, 34 and 21 %, respectively), and the percentage of women in academic medicine in top leadership positions, such as department chairs and deans, remains low (15 and 16 %, respectively). The same report highlights that despite modest progress in the proportion of new faculty hires who are women (up 4 % since 2008), the steady attrition of women out of the academic advancement pipeline has remained essentially unchanged for over 25 years,4 and that the proportion of faculty departures who are women is rising (up 5 % since 2008). Successful career progression requires interaction of positive influences on both the individual and institutional levels, since each can influence a faculty member’s available time, resources, drive, and productivity. Many obstacles are encountered by men and women faculty during their academic careers, determined by individual, family, and institutional/societal influences. Although some of the same problems affect both sexes (as summarized in the article by Holliday), it is important to focuses on the special issues facing women as they contribute to differential outcomes.5,6 Holliday et al.’s article is an important contribution, since it highlights issues that should be fairly easy to address. Although demand for family care responsibilities and career satisfaction were not assessed in the study by Holliday et al., other studies have shown that women with children have less institutional support, fewer publications, slower self-perceived career progress, and lower career satisfaction.5,7 Given that in the study of K awardees, the majority of K-23 awards (clinician scientist) were held by women (64 %) and the majority of K-08 awards (basic scientist) were held by men (60 %), it would be of interest to know the extent to which differences in the types of awards and their demands played a role in the findings of the study. Women are often the canaries in the coal mine. Though women were impacted more in Holliday et al.’s study, we find it interesting that men also reported feeling disadvantaged regarding resources. Men and women equally made requests for support that were often only partially fulfilled, and both genders reported experiencing unfair treatment. Our own work8 has identified vulnerable faculty groups for career dissatisfaction, one of which is male faculty in the early career stage. The inherent conflicts and stressors affecting satisfaction of early career faculty may be similar for both genders, due to changing generational values for family, work-like integration, and career flexibility.9 Other studies have also shown that a substantial proportion of both men and women report that conflicts between work, family and career are significant determinants of career dissatisfaction and a strong predictor of leaving a career in academic medicine.10 Recent work by the Work Family Institute demonstrates that there is growing work-life conflict among men in the younger generations and that men are stigmatized when they seek solutions typically utilized by women, such as flexible work schedules. If left unaddressed, the unmet needs of early career faculty are potentially significant threats to a successful academic medical workforce. A number of approaches have been proposed and are being utilized to support the careers of women faculty.11 They include attending to generational issues and career flexibility in academia; building multigenerational team environments; developing policies aimed at improving work-life compatibility to lessen conflict; creating a supportive culture; providing adequate compensation and rewards for productivity; aligning demands placed on faculty with strategic priorities; and supporting research careers. The ability of academic medical centers to retain women faculty is particularly important to excellence in patient care, teaching and research, to ensure appropriate role modeling for junior faculty, and to provide for diversity at all levels, including leadership. Action steps to advance women faculty at academic medical centers include advocacy and support for women faculty and women leaders, and mentoring and coaching programs that include men in the conversation about how to mentor and advance women. It is as yet unclear whether the approaches currently being implemented at academic health systems nationwide will help to stem the tide of women exiting academic careers. The findings of the work of Holliday et al. suggest several directions for future research and organizational change: The evidence base is needed to determine whether deficiencies in research support result from difficulties some women have with informal negotiations, and whether providing directed skill building in communication and negotiation can impact career outcomes; similarly, if unconscious biases predominate in less structured settings as suggested by the article by Holliday et al., effective attitudinal change models should be developed and tested, utilizing education, role play, feedback or other techniques with promise for delivering change, such as those in the AAMC’s learning lab (https://www.aamc.org/initiatives/diversity/322996/lablearningonunconsciousbias.html, accessed November 10, 2014). Data and policies alone may not be enough to address the unfair treatment reported by women, and to a lesser extent men, in the work of Holliday and colleagues. Institutional leadership, sustained efforts, and actionable strategies will be necessary at all levels to reform workplace climate and culture, and to address systematic constraints, in order to recognize and address the elements of institutional life that may disproportionately disadvantage women. Additional approaches yet to be tested include institutional practices that promote equity, ‘lean in’ circles and networks for professional support, and the outcomes of current best practices. In addition, it is as yet unclear whether current trends favoring team-based science and resource sharing will favorably impact women’s careers and their advancement, and data-driven efforts are needed to demonstrate results in this realm. While we recognize the need for additional focused research efforts to understand the under-representation of women in academia and the elements of dissatisfaction that lead to departure, it is clear that the pace of progress will need to increase. Now more than ever, the strategic advantage of a satisfied workforce will allow academic institutions to not only train but also attract, retain and advance the top talent that will be critical to meet the workforce, healthcare, scientific, and resource demands of the future.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[4.3784291392512387e-07, 1.2212365163577488e-06, 2.493232568667736e-05, 0.9999934434890747, 4.362565846349753e-07, 1.5612238257745048e-06, 8.049037205637433e-07, 5.743371502830996e-07, 2.0120373847021256e-06]"

121,"tobacco cessation among low income smokers motivational enhancement and nicotine patch treatment INTRODUCTION Despite decades of tobacco use decline among the general population in the United States, tobacco use among low-income populations continues to be a major public health concern. Smoking rates are higher among individuals with less than a high school education, those with no health insurance, and among individuals living below the federal poverty level. Despite these disparities, smoking cessation treatments for low-income populations have not been extensively tested. In the current study, the efficacy of 2 adjunctive smoking cessation interventions was evaluated among low-income smokers who were seen in a primary care setting. METHODS A total of 846 participants were randomly assigned either to motivational enhancement treatment plus brief physician advice and 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or to standard care, which consisted of brief physician advice and 8 weeks of NRT. Tobacco smoking abstinence was at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months following baseline. RESULTS The use of the nicotine patch, telephone counseling, and positive decisional balance were predictive of increased abstinence rates, and elevated stress levels and temptation to smoke in both social/habit and negative affect situations decreased abstinence rates across time. Analyses showed intervention effects on smoking temptations, length of patch use, and number of telephone contacts. Direct intervention effects on abstinence rates were not significant, after adjusting for model predictors and selection bias due to perirandomization attrition.

Walking is a key focus of public health interventions yet is particularly uncommon in rural residents. This study s purpose was to determine whether a multilevel community intervention affected rates of moderate physical activity, in particular walking. Methods. A quasi-experimental design examined changes in walking in six rural intervention communities in Missouri and six comparison communities in Arkansas and Tennessee in 2003–2004. Interventions were developed with community input and included individually tailored newsletters; interpersonal activities that stressed social support and health provider counseling; and community-wide events such as fun walks. A dose variable estimated exposure to intervention activities. Primary outcomes were rates of walking and moderate physical activity in the past week. Results. At follow-up ( n = 1531), the percentage of respondents who met the recommendation for walking was the same across the intervention and comparison areas. Among the dependent variables, walking showed some evidence of a positive linear trend across dose categories ( P = 0.090). After adjusting for covariates and baseline rates, intervention participants in the moderate and high dose categories were about three times more likely to meet recommended guidelines for walking.

123,"identifying inequitable exposure to toxic air pollution in racialized and low income neighbourhoods to support pollution prevention Numerous environmental justice studies have confirmed a relationship between population characteristics such as low-income or minority status and the location of environmental health hazards. However, studies of the health risks from exposure to harmful substances often do not consider their toxicological characteristics. We used two different methods, the unit-hazard and the distance-based approach, to evaluate demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the population residing near industrial facilities in the City of Toronto, Canada. In addition to the mass of air emissions obtained from the national pollutant release inventory (NPRI), we also considered their toxicity using toxic equivalency potential (TEP) scores. Results from the unit-hazard approach indicate no significant difference in the proportion of low-income individuals living in host versus non-host census tracts (t(107) = 0.3, P = 0.735). However, using the distance-based approach, the proportion of low-income individuals was significantly higher (+5.1%, t(522) = 6.0, P <0.001) in host tracts, while the indicator for “racialized” communities (“visible minority”) was 16.1% greater (t(521) = 7.2, P <0.001) within 2 km of a NPRI facility. When the most toxic facilities by non-carcinogenic TEP score were selected, the rate of visible minorities living near the most toxic NPRI facilities was significantly higher (+12.9%, t(352) = 3.5, P = 0.001) than near all other NPRI facilities. TEP scores were also used to identify areas in Toronto that face a double burden of poverty and air toxics exposure in order to prioritise pollution prevention.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[1.284009954360954e-06, 0.999950647354126, 2.1034285964560695e-05, 4.540662757790415e-06, 3.569694229099696e-07, 0.9868513941764832, 0.999998927116394, 5.703613510377181e-07, 6.271504275900952e-07]"
124,"do racial or socioeconomic disparities exist in lung cancer treatment BACKGROUND: Determine the effects of race, socioeconomic status, and treatment on outcomes for patients diagnosed with lung cancer. METHODS: The Florida cancer registry and inpatient and ambulatory data were queried for patients diagnosed from 1998-2002. RESULTS: A total 76,086 of lung cancer patients were identified. Overall, 55.6% were male and 44.4% were female. The demographic distribution of patients was 92.7% Caucasian, 6.7% African American, and 5.7% Hispanic. The mean age of diagnosis was 70 years old. African American patients presented at a younger age, with more advanced disease, and were less likely to undergo surgical therapy than their Caucasian counterparts. Median survival time (MST) for the entire cohort was 8.7 months, while MST for African American patients was 7.5 months. Patients who received surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy demonstrated significantly improved outcomes. Stepwise multivariate analysis revealed that African American race was no longer a statistically significant predictor of worse outcomes once corrections were made for demographics and comorbid conditions, suggesting that the originally reported disparities in lung cancer outcomes and race may be in part because of poor pretreatment performance status. In contrast, patients of the lowest socioeconomic status continue to have a slightly worse overall prognosis than their affluent counterparts (hazard ratio = 1.05, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer continues to carry a poor prognosis for all patients. Once comorbidities are corrected for, African American patients carry equivalently poor outcomes.

126,"effects of the child and adolescent trial for cardiovascular health catch on fruit and vegetable intake Abstract The purpose of this article is to report the impact of the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) on fruit and vegetable consumption of third-through fifth-grade children.The primary messages delivered in the CATCH interventions concerned dietary fat, dietary sodium, physical activity, and smoking. However, a significant portion of the classroom curricula, parental involvement programs, and food service changes were directed at promoting a generally healthful diet, including increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Therefore, it is of interest whether the general nutrition intervention was sufficient to effect an increase in intake of fruits and vegetables. Intakes were assessed using single, food-record-assisted 24-hour recalls at baseline and follow-up.The final sample size for paired baseline and follow-up recalls was 1186.The mean unadjusted daily intake of fruits and vegetables for the entire cohort at follow-up was 4.04 servings; for fruit it was 2.13 servings, and for vegetables it was 1.91 servings.The analyses of variance revealed no differences in fruit and vegetable consumption at follow-up due to site, sex, race, sex by race, condition by sex, condition by race, or condition by race by sex.

127,"couple oriented education and support intervention effects on individuals with osteoarthritis and their spouses Objective: To determine whether a couple-oriented intervention for osteoarthritis (OA) was more efficacious than a patient-oriented intervention and whether each intervention was more efficacious than usual medical care. Research Design: 242 older adults with OA and their spouses were randomly assigned to patient-oriented education and support, couple-oriented education and support, or usual care. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses indicated no significant differences between the 3 study conditions in outcomes for individuals with OA or their spouses. Completers analyses showed that at the 6-month follow-up, contrary to prediction, individuals with OA who received the patient-oriented intervention reported greater reductions in pain and improvements in physical function than those who received the couple-oriented intervention. At the postintervention assessment, spouses who received the coupleoriented intervention reported greater reductions in stress and a trend toward less critical attitudes than spouses of individuals with OA who received the patient-oriented intervention. Moderator analyses indicated that female spouses and spouses with high marital satisfaction who received the couple-oriented intervention also experienced better outcomes in terms of depressive symptoms and caregiver mastery. Conclusions: A couples approach to education and support for OA may offer no advantage for individuals with OA but may prove helpful for spouses, thereby indirectly benefiting individuals with OA over time.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.999977707862854, 3.78857075702399e-05, 1.562607394589577e-05, 0.9999943971633911, 3.5619135019260284e-07, 0.9827809929847717, 9.496649909124244e-06, 8.405717380810529e-05, 9.848531590250786e-07]"
128,"economic analysis of promotion of hepatitis b vaccinations among vietnamese american children and adolescents in houston and dallas Hasymptomatic,epatitis B virus (HBV) infection is most often acute, and resolves without serious long-term effects.1 However, 70% to 90% of infants infected at birth, 30% to 50% of children infected between 1 year and 5 years, and 5% to 10% of people infected after the age of 7 years will develop chronic HBV infection, which often results in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or primary hepatocellular carcinoma.1 Studies have shown that 1 of every 4 people with chronic HBV infection eventually dies of cirrhosis or liver cancer.2 Among children in the United States, HBV infection disproportionately affects those in Asian and Pacific Islander (API) populations, including Vietnamese.3–9 Among US Viet-namese adults, the prevalence of those ever infected with HBV is as high as 80%10 compared with 3.8% in US whites.9 Studies also have documented chronic HBV infection rates ranging from 7% to 14%11–14 among US Vietnamese adults compared with 0.2% in US white adults.15 Vietnamese-American males have the highest liver cancer incidence rate of any racial/ethnic group (41.8 per 100 000), 11 times that among white males,16 and 80% of their liver cancers are caused by HBV infection.17 Hepatitis B vaccination of API infants and children was first recommended in 1982 by the US Public Health Service Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) as a 3-dose series administered over 6 months.18 By 1995, fewer than 10% of the estimated 1 million API children in the United States born in 1984 through 1993 had received the hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) 3-dose series.3 Consequently, in October 1995, “catch-up” vaccination for most API children born after 1983 was recommended.3 In 1997, the ACIP recommended universal vaccination of all children through age 18. These and other increasingly stronger ACIP recommendations have made it easier to provide HepB to API children in the United States. However, effectively conveying the message that HBV infection is a serious problem that can be easily prevented by 3 doses of vaccine to parents of many different cultural and language groups and their physicians, has been a difficult and slow process.19 A previous study of a hepatitis B catch-up vaccination program among an ethnically diverse community of APIs in Philadelphia found that their catch-up intervention was cost-effective and cost beneficial, although the increase in coverage was modest.20 This Philadelphia intervention was conducted in 2 communities with a diverse Southeast Asian population and primarily used community outreach with some donated media assistance. The intervention used a personalized approach in that the investigators formed a registry with the names and addresses of each targeted child and used in-home education and vaccination to accomplish their goals. In this article, we document the cost-effectiveness (CE) and the benefit-cost ratios of a federally funded project designed to raise hepatitis B vaccination coverage among 1 API ethnic group—Vietnamese-Americans—in the Houston and Dallas areas using 2 types of intervention.21–23 One intervention was a community mobilization strategy similar to most local public health interventions without a professionally developed media campaign. A coalition of local leaders conducted educational outreach via registration of physicians as Vaccines for Children (VFC) providers, distribution of referral lists of VFC providers, distribution of health education brochures, health fairs, targeted mailings, educational presentations, and use of free local media. The other intervention was media education that relied only on a professionally developed advertising campaign with billboards, prime-time radio spots, newspaper articles and ads, brochures and calendars, and telephone hot-line. As reported elsewhere, both intervention strategies resulted in statistically significantly increased vaccination coverage among Vietnamese-American children aged 3 to 18 years and increased their parents’ knowledge about hepatitis B.23 Since 1994 when the first ACIP catch-up recommendation was made, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had monitored progress using the birth cohorts 1984–1993.24 Thus, we chose to confine our economic evaluation to these birth cohorts. The 1984–1993 birth cohorts are a subset of the cohorts analyzed in our companion epidemiology article.23 Here our economic focus is on intervention-related costs, such as vaccine/administration fees, parent time lost, personnel costs, and subcontractor payments. Other important costs and benefits, such as preventing pain and suffering among family and friends of the ill patient are difficult to quantify, and are not included here.

The external image of individuals appears to have a decisive influence on their behavior and personal choices regarding both their personal and professional lives. Accordingly, it can be assumed that appearance influences professional choices and development. Moreover, individuals associate increased self-confidence with positive social images. Therefore, the main variables used in this study were self-image, self-confidence, and work environment. For the purpose of this study, the authors developed a questionnaire and distributed it to a sample of 100 women who had undergone aesthetic plastic surgery.

They conducted a search of appropriate computerized databases for studies that evaluated psychological and psychosocial status both before and after elective cosmetic surgery. They identified 37 relevant studies of varying cosmetic procedures that utilized disparate methodologies. Overall, patients appeared generally satisfied with the outcome of their procedures, although some exhibited transient and some exhibited longer-lasting psychological disturbance. Factors associated with poor psychosocial outcome included being young, being male, having unrealistic expectations of the procedure, previous unsatisfactory cosmetic surgery, minimal deformity, motivation based on relationship issues, and a history of depression, anxiety, or personality disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder was also recognized by some studies as a predictor of poor outcome, a finding reinforced by reference to the psychiatric literature. The authors conclude that although most people appear satisfied with the outcome of cosmetic surgical procedures, some are not, and attempts should be made to screen for such individuals in cosmetic surgery settings.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[6.313673566182842e-07, 1.317800638389599e-06, 1.1492668818391394e-05, 0.9999812841415405, 4.3540492811189324e-07, 2.4545411179133225e-06, 8.858139040057722e-07, 7.006310625001788e-07, 0.9999990463256836]"
134,"grounded citizens juries a tool for health activism Involving the public in decision-making has become a bureaucratic pre-occupation for every health agency in the UK. In this paper we offer an innovative approach for local participation in health decision-making through the development of a ‘grounded’ citizens’ jury. We describe the process of one such jury commissioned by a Primary Care Group in the north-west of England, which was located in an area suffering intractable health inequalities. Twelve local people aged between 17 and 70 were recruited to come together for a week to hear evidence, ask questions and debate what they felt would improve the health and well-being of people living in the area. The jury process acted effectively as a grass-roots health needs assessment and amongst other outcomes, resulted in the setting up of a community health centre run by a board consisting of members of the community (including two jurors) together with local agencies. The methodology described here contrasts with that practiced by what we term ‘the consultation industry’, which is primarily interested in the use of fixed models to generate the public view as a standardized output, a product, developed to serve the needs of an established policy process, with little interest in effecting change. We outline four principles underpinning our approach: deliberation, integration, sustainability and accountability. We argue that citizens’ juries and other consultation initiatives need to be reclaimed from that which merely serves the policy process and become ‘grounded’, a tool for activism, in which local people are agents in the development of policies affecting their lives.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999898672103882, 0.9904620051383972, 3.984947397839278e-05, 5.751528988184873e-06, 3.8919537814763316e-07, 7.611091405124171e-06, 0.9755605459213257, 1.2617330185094033e-06, 9.959055660146987e-07]"
135,"randomised controlled trial of electrical stimulation of the quadriceps after proximal femoral fracture Background and aims: Proximal femoral fracture is often associated with long-term residual disability. Quadriceps weakness may be a factor in poor outcome. This study aimed to determine whether training of the quadriceps using electrical stimulation (ES) increases leg extensor power and decreases disability in elderly subjects rehabilitating after fracture. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial of elderly postsurgical proximal femoral fracture patients, comparing 6 weeks of supplementary electrical stimulation of the quadriceps (15 patients) to usual physiotherapy alone (11 patients). The electrical stimulation on:off duty cycle was 7:23 seconds, with 36 cycles per session, given daily as an in-patient and twice weekly after discharge. The primary outcome measure was change in leg extensor power (Nottingham Power Rig). Functional mobility (Elderly Mobility Scale), disability (Barthel Index) and health status (Nottingham Health Profile) were also measured. Results: There was no significant difference in change in leg extensor power, or any other outcome measure, in the ES group compared to usualcare controls. Fractured leg extensor power increased by 10.9 (standard error of the mean 2.1) Watts at 6 weeks in the ES group compared to 15.3 (5.5) in the controls (mean adjusted difference −3.1, 95% CI −7.8, 1.6 Watts). Only 3 (20%) of the intervention patients tolerated sufficient stimulation intensity to produce repetitive knee extension, while 11 (73%) sustained palpable or visible contractions with no leg movement. Conclusion: A 6-week program of electrical stimulation of the quadriceps did not increase leg extensor power, or reduce disability, in elderly patients rehabilitating after surgical fixation of proximal femoral fracture.

Five hundred and one men and women aged between 16 and 79 (mean 34.5 years) were assessed using standardised questionnaires and clinical interview carried out by two clinical psychologists specialising in the field. Results indicated very marked impact of appearance-related anxiety with significant withdrawal from social activities particularly intimate behaviour. Coping behaviours ranged from use of concealing clothing and complete social avoidance to ominous high risk strategies such as repeated pregnancy with late termination to maintain breast size. Treatment goals were predominantly psychosocial. High levels of psychological morbidity can be characterised as typical of people requesting cosmetic procedures in the NHS rather than exceptional, making the achievement of equitable access to limited resources impossible. Rather than define this population as low-priority , a constructive approach is to examine the utility of psychological interventions in a design which evaluates the comparative benefits of surgical and psychological approaches to management of appearance anxiety.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[2.101295876855147e-06, 2.069496076728683e-06, 1.155402060248889e-05, 1.6162684914888814e-05, 3.6026699490321334e-07, 1.4915562132955529e-05, 4.155196620558854e-06, 8.647025993013813e-07, 0.9999850988388062]"
139,"patterns of hematuria referral to urologists does a gender disparity exist Objectives To examine the referral patterns of hematuria within a nonprofit healthcare organization to determine the factors that influence referral. Hematuria continues to be an important sign of urologic disease, including urothelial malignancy. An increasing awareness of gender differences in tumor stage at bladder cancer presentation has led to speculation about delayed referral and diagnosis in women. However, little is known about the referral patterns of hematuria and whether gender differences exist. Methods The insurance records were examined from 926 consecutive adult health plan participants (559 men and 367 women) with newly diagnosed hematuria from 1998 to 2002. The patterns of urologic referral were evaluated. A Cox multivariate regression model was used to examine the relationship between urologic referral and the relevant variables. Results Overall, 263 men (47%) and 102 women (28%) were referred for urologic evaluation of hematuria, with a median follow-up of 27 and 26 months, respectively. Referral was initiated by the primary care physician in 80% of the cohort. Increased urologic referral was associated with advancing age, repeated hematuria, provider type, and male gender. The adjusted hazard ratio of male referral was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.31-2.08) compared with female referral. Conclusions Primary care physicians practicing in a managed care setting are less likely to refer women for a urologic evaluation of new or first recurrent episodes of hematuria than to refer men in all patient age categories, except for 40-49 years. This apparent gender disparity could result in unequal access of specialty evaluation and could potentially delay the diagnosis of important urologic conditions.","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[4.814555154553091e-07, 9.353489645036461e-07, 9.356564987683669e-06, 0.999923825263977, 3.357756952482305e-07, 0.999981164932251, 0.9999724626541138, 4.417115064825339e-07, 4.474498928175308e-05]"

Both interventions were culturally competent regarding language, diet, social emphasis, family participation, and incorporating cultural beliefs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS —We recruited 216 persons between 35 and 70 years of age diagnosed with type 2 diabetes ≥1 year. Intervention groups of eight participants and eight support persons were randomly assigned to the compressed or extended conditions. The interventions differed in total number of contact hours over the yearlong intervention period, with the major difference being the number of support group sessions held. The same information provided in the educational sessions of the extended intervention was compressed into fewer sessions, thus providing more information during each group meeting. RESULTS —The interventions were not statistically different in reducing HbA 1c ; however, both were effective. A “dosage effect” of attendance was detected with the largest HbA 1c reductions achieved by those who attended more of the extended intervention. For individuals who attended ≥50% of the intervention, baseline to 12-month HbA 1c change was −0.6 percentage points for the compressed group and −1.7 percentage points for the extended group. CONCLUSIONS —Both culturally competent diabetes self-management education interventions were effective in promoting improved metabolic control and diabetes knowledge.

145,an incentivized hiv counseling and testing program targeting hard to reach unemployed men in cape town south africa BACKGROUND: In Southern Africa men access HIV counseling and testing (HCT) services less than women. Innovative strategies are needed to increase uptake of testing among men. This study assessed the effectiveness of incentivized mobile HCT in reaching unemployed men in Cape Town South Africa. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of HCT data collected between August 2008 and August 2010 from adult men accessing clinic-based stationary and non-incentivized and incentivized mobile services. Data from these 3 services were analyzed using descriptive statistics and log-binomial regression models. RESULTS: A total of 9416 first-time testers were included in the analysis as follows: 708 were clinic based 4985 were non-incentivized and 3723 incentivized mobile service testers. A higher HIV prevalence was observed among men accessing incentivized mobile testing [16.6% (617/3723)] compared with those attending non-incentivized mobile [5.5% (277/4985)] and clinic-based services [10.2% (72/708)]. Among men testing at the mobile service greater proportions of men receiving incentives were self-reported first-time testers (60.1% vs. 42.0%) and had advanced disease (14.9% vs. 7.5%) compared with men testing at non-incentivized mobile services. Furthermore compared with the non-incentivized mobile service the incentivized service was associated with a 3-fold greater yield of newly diagnosed HIV infections. This strong association persisted in analyses adjusted for age and first-time versus repeat testing [risk ratio: 2.33 (95% confidence interval: 2.03 to 2.57); P < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that incentivized mobile testing services may reach more previously untested men and significantly increase detection of HIV infection in men.,"[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.00011713984713423997, 8.768441830397933e-07, 8.188633728423156e-06, 0.5155354738235474, 7.221169653348625e-07, 1.8128133660866297e-06, 8.95457651495235e-06, 7.039979550427233e-07, 0.9999982118606567]"

This study aimed to assess the nutritional knowledge and understanding of primary school children in order to identify the most effective format for future nutrition messages. A qualitative methodology was employed and 114 children, aged 7-11 years, took part in 23 focus groups separated by age, gender and socio-economic status (SES). Issues discussed included parental food rules, children s perceptions of good and bad foods, diet-disease links and food groupings. Across the groups restrictive food rules were most frequently reported whilst between groups gender and SES differences were apparent in relation to parental control over food and children s nutritional knowledge. The limitations of the children s cognitive development could be seen in their conceptualization of food groups, where concrete grouping schemes were frequently used, and in the lack of understanding inherent in their food-health or food-nutrient associations. Taste and preference were confirmed as consistent influences in children s food classification. Primary school children may be receptive to food based dietary guidelines based on familiar, concrete food classifications.

150,"young teenagers perceptions of their own and others bodies a qualitative study of obese overweight and normal weight young people in scotland The rise in numbers of overweight/obese children in the UK is causing widespread concern. Biomedical constructions of body acceptability and good health mean that overweight/obese young people are frequently seen as deviant. The socio-cultural contexts within which young teenagers become fat, and lay conceptualisations of fatness, have largely been ignored. This qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with teenagers aged 13-14 years (n = 36), drawn from families living in areas classified as socio-economically disadvantaged. Half of the sample had a Body Mass Index (BMI) classifying them as overweight or obese, whilst the remainder were classified as being normal weight. Participants embodied perceptions of fatness were complex and sometimes contradictory. We discuss what young teenagers perceive the influences on fatness and body size to be; the professed consequences of being fat; participants experiences of attempting to lose weight; and, their reported interactions with friends and family relating to fatness and dieting. Participants rarely mentioned any health-related consequences of their own and others fatness, although wearing nice clothes and being slowed down were raised as considerations by girls and boys, respectively. Normal weight teenagers who disliked their bodies or who wanted to lose weight often claimed to be anxious about this. Being very obese also led to anxiety and reported attempts at crash dieting . Acceptance of body size/shape was, however, common amongst the overweight and obese teenagers, although some had attempted weight loss. The teenagers in this study were rarely supportive of friends or family who attempted to lose weight and frequently disagreed with others perceptions of fatness. These findings are important as they contradict the common perception that being overweight/obese is related to body dissatisfaction and that young people have a fear of fatness.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999984502792358, 5.478542334458325e-06, 2.8934327929164283e-05, 0.00010769528307719156, 3.691327776778053e-07, 2.725856802499038e-06, 0.9921481013298035, 5.12076780978532e-07, 0.015629922971129417]"

A total of 78 boys age 15 and 16 years were allocated to either undertake MoodGYM or to standard personal development activities. Outcomes were measured before commencement, post-program and 16 weeks post-program. There were no significant between-group differences in change scores pre- to post- or pre- to follow-up using the intention to treat sample or for participants with post- and/or follow-up data. For boys completing 3 or more modules there were small relative benefits of MoodGYM for depressive symptoms (Effect Size, ES = 0.34), attributional style (ES = 0.17) and self-esteem (ES = 0.16) at post-program, although only the effect for self-esteem was sustained at follow-up. Both groups showed improvement in their beliefs about depression at follow-up, with the control group showing a moderate relative benefit (ES = 0.40). While the numbers are small, there was a reduction in the risk of being depressed in the MoodGYM group of 9% at post-treatment compared with a slightly increased risk for the control group. The risk of being classified as vulnerable to depression reduced by 17% in the MoodGYM group at post-treatment compared with no change in risk for the control group.

Thirty breast augmentation candidates completed several measures of body image before their initial surgical consultation. Thirty physically similar women who were not interested in breast augmentation were recruited from the medical center and university community and also completed the measures. Breast augmentation candidates, as compared with women not seeking augmentation, reported greater dissatisfaction with their breasts. Augmentation candidates rated their ideal breast size, as well as the breast size preferred by women, as significantly larger than did controls. In addition, women interested in breast augmentation reported greater investment in their appearance, greater distress about their appearance in a variety of situations, and more frequent teasing about their appearance. Finally, breast augmentation candidates also reported more frequent use of psychotherapy in the year before the operation as compared with women not seeking augmentation.

155,"constituting the public in public participation The emphasis on public participation in contemporary policy discourse has prompted the development of a wide range of forums within which dialogue takes place between citizens and officials. Often such initiatives are intended to contribute to objectives relating to social exclusion and democratic renewal. The question of who takes part within such forums is, then, critical to an understanding of how far new types of forums can contribute to the delivery of such objectives. This article draws on early findings of research conducted as part of the ESRC Democracy and Participation Programme. It addresses three questions: How do public bodies define or constitute the public that they wish to engage in dialogue? ; What notions of representation or representativeness do participants and public officials bring to the idea of legitimate membership of such forums? ; and How do deliberative forums contribute to, or help ameliorate, processes of social inclusion and exclusion?","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[0.9828171730041504, 2.901050038417452e-06, 7.875123992562294e-05, 9.396849236509297e-06, 4.267583335604286e-07, 1.072342274710536e-05, 0.9999978542327881, 2.384958861512132e-06, 0.9298191666603088]"

160,"effectiveness of a breastfeeding peer coaching intervention in rural scotland Abstract: Background:Breastfeeding initiation in Scotland in 2000 was 63 percent, compared with over 90 percent in Norway and Sweden. Although peer support is effective in improving exclusivity of breastfeeding in countries where over 80 percent of women initiate breastfeeding, the evidence for effectiveness in countries with lower initiation is uncertain. Our primary aim was to assess whether group-based and one-to-one peer breastfeeding coaching improves breastfeeding initiation and duration.Methods:Action research methodology was used to conduct an intervention study in 4 geographical postcode areas in rural northeast Scotland. Infant feeding outcomes at birth and hospital discharge; at 1, 2, and 6 weeks; and at 4 and 8 months were collected for 598 of 626 women with live births during a 9-month baseline period and for 557 of 592 women with live births during a 9-month intervention period. Groups met in 5 locations, with 266 groups meeting in the period when intervention women were eligible to attend. Data on place of birth and length of postnatal hospital stay were also collected. Control data from 10 other Health Board areas in Scotland were compared. An intention-to participate survey about coaching participation was completed by 206 of 345 women initiating breastfeeding. Group attendance data were collected by means of 266 group diaries.Results:There was a significant increase in any breastfeeding of 6.8 percent from 34.3 to 41.1 percent (95% CI 1.2, 12.4) in the study population at 2 weeks after birth compared with a decline in any breastfeeding in the rest of Scotland of 0.4 percent from 44 to 43.6 percent (95% CI −1.2, 0.4). Breastfeeding rates increased compared with baseline rates at all time points until 8 months. However, the effect was not uniform across the 4 postcode areas and was not related to level of deprivation. Little difference was seen in receipt of information and knowledge about the availability of coaching among areas. All breastfeeding groups were well attended, popular, and considered helpful by participants. A minority of women (n = 14/206) participated in formal one-to-one coaching. Women who received antenatal, birth, and postnatal care from community midwife-led units were more likely to be breastfeeding at 2 weeks (p = 0.007) than women who received some or all care in district maternity units.Conclusions:Group-based and one-to-one peer coaching for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers increased breastfeeding initiation and duration in an area with below average breastfeeding rates.

166,"physical activity as a mediator linking neighborhood environmental supports and obesity in african americans in the path trial Obesity is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. More than 30% of adults are obese, with African Americans disproportionately represented (Flegal, Carroll, Kit, & Ogden, 2012). Despite evidence that regular engagement in physical activity (PA) may prevent the development of overweight and obesity (Brock et al., 2009), most adults in the United States do not meet national recommendations for PA (Troiano et al., 2008). Lack of regular PA is particularly evident among African American adults (Prus, 2007). To address disparities in obesity, it is a public health priority to identify factors that promote higher levels of engagement in PA in African Americans. In the present study, a bioecological framework was used to identify factors that are associated with positive health behaviors. This approach posits that health behaviors are influenced by conditions in the social and physical environment, in addition to individual factors (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, 1994; McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988; Spence & Lee, 2003). Indeed, accumulating evidence has indicated that environmental and social factors are important for promoting PA (Sallis et al., 2009; Trost, Owen, Bauman, Sallis, & Brown, 2002). These factors may be particularly important in underserved African American adults who experience limited access to health-promoting contexts and services (Gordon-Larsen, Nelson, Page, & Popkin, 2006). Further, similar environments may have different health impacts for African Americans than for other racial and ethnic groups (Hooker, Wilson, Griffin, & Ainsworth, 2005). The present study expands on a limited literature that examines the association of environmental and social factors with PA in under-served African American adults, and tests whether PA is a potential mechanism linking these factors with obesity. One aspect of the environment that has received increased attention over the past decade is neighborhood walkability. Two features related to neighborhood walkability that have been shown to be consistently associated with PA in predominantly nonminority samples are infrastructure for walking (e.g., sidewalks, trails) and access to services within walking distance (Owen, Humpel, Leslie, Bauman, & Sallis, 2004; Sallis et al., 2009). Studies with ethnically diverse samples have also found associations between these neighborhood features and PA (Addy et al., 2004; King et al., 2005; Parks, Housemann, & Brownson, 2003). A limited number of studies have examined associations between the neighborhood environment and PA in African American adults, yielding inconsistent findings, but providing some support for the importance of neighborhood walkability for PA in this population (Casagrande, Whitt-Glover, Lancaster, Odoms-Young, & Gary, 2009). For example, some studies have found associations between features of neighborhood walkability (such as infrastructure for walking) and PA in African Americans, including engaging in recommended levels of PA and leisure-time PA (Ainsworth, Wilcox, Thompson, Richter, & Henderson, 2003; Heinrich et al., 2007); however, other studies have not (King et al., 2000; Rohm Young & Voorhees, 2003; Sanderson et al., 2003). Another neighborhood feature—crime—has been frequently cited as a barrier to PA in qualitative studies (Eyler et al., 1998; Holman, Donovan, & Corti, 1996). However, quantitative evidence of this association has been mixed in both predominantly nonminority samples (Foster & Giles-Corti, 2008) and African American adults (Casagrande et al., 2009). Whereas some studies have found an association between crime and PA in minority samples, including African Americans (Addy et al., 2004; Eyler et al., 2003; Hannon, Sawyer, & Allman, 2012; Wilbur, Chandler, Dancy, & Lee, 2003), other studies have not (Bennett et al., 2007; Hooker et al., 2005; King et al., 2000; Rohm Young & Voorhees, 2003; Sanderson et al., 2003). Nonetheless, because safety concerns have been identified as a barrier to PA in qualitative studies, crime warrants further investigation, particularly in underserved African Americans. Social support, defined broadly as resources and encouragement provided by others, has also been identified as an important correlate of PA (Trost et al., 2002). Social support can come from different sources, including family and friends, and can take various forms, including instrumental and tangible (e.g., direct assistance), informational (e.g., PA suggestions), and emotional (e.g., encouragement) support (Harley et al., 2009). The few studies that have examined associations between social support and PA in African Americans have suggested the importance of social support for PA, but findings have been inconsistent. For example, although there is some evidence that family support is particularly important for PA in African Americans (Komar-Samardzija, Braun, Keithley, & Quinn, 2012), other studies have found support provided by friends, not family, to be associated with PA in this population (Peterson & Cheng, 2011; Sharma, Sargent, & Stacy, 2005). Moreover, some previous studies have shown that social support provided by either family or friends is associated with PA in African American men (Hooker, Harmon, Burroughs, Rheaume, & Wilcox, 2011) and women (Eyler et al., 1999). Other studies, however, have not found support provided by both friends and family combined to be associated with PA (Bopp et al., 2006; Li et al., 2012). Thus, an understanding of the association between social support and PA remains limited in African American adults. In summary, previous studies have shown that neighborhood walkability and social support are associated with higher levels of PA. However, less is known about these associations in under-served African American adults or about health behaviors, such as PA, as potential pathways through which environmental and social factors may be linked to obesity. Previous research with nonminority populations has provided mixed evidence that PA is a mediator of these associations. One study found that both objective and self-report measures of PA mediated linkages between neighborhood walkability and weight-related outcomes (Van Dyck et al., 2010). Other studies, however, have not found self-reported PA to be a mediator linking perceptions of the environment and social support with self-rated health (Poortinga, 2006a, 2006b). Additional research is needed to identify specific mechanisms that link environmental and social factors with obesity, particularly in underserved African American adults. The purpose of the present study was to examine PA as a potential mediator of associations of neighborhood walkability and social support with obesity in African American adults as part of the Positive Action for Today’s Health (PATH) randomized trial (Coulon et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2010). Three communities were identified and matched based on U.S. Census information (e.g., crime, PA, poverty, percent minority) and recruited to participate in the 24-month study. The primary aims of the trial were to compare a combined police-patrolled walking and social marketing intervention to a police-patrolled walking only or a walking-only intervention on increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) after 12 months and to examine the maintenance of effects over 24 months. Longitudinal data are not yet available; therefore, cross-sectional data were the focus of this study. Potential pathways through which environmental and social factors may influence obesity were examined by estimating the effects of neighborhood walkability, social support, and PA on body mass index (BMI) in the PATH sample at baseline. It was hypothesized that greater walkability and peer social support would be associated with increased time spent engaging in PA and lower BMI, and that greater PA would be associated with lower BMI. It was further hypothesized that PA would mediate associations of neighborhood walkability and social support with BMI. To better understand PA as a potential mechanism linking these factors with BMI, hypotheses were tested in a primary model, with accelerometry-assessed MVPA as a mediator, and, in secondary models, with self-reported walking and exercise as mediators.","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.6466989336549887e-06, 0.9999939203262329, 0.47495660185813904, 0.0003213740128558129, 3.566277655409067e-07, 0.00032486606505699456, 0.9999986886978149, 5.057649445916468e-07, 2.7049120490119094e-06]"

Participants: Clinical population of community-dwelling men and women (aged 60þ) recovering from hip fracture. Participants were randomly assigned into control (n ¼ 41) or intervention (n ¼ 40) groups on average 42 � 23 days after discharge home. Intervention: A yearlong multicomponent home-based rehabilitation aimed at promoting mobility recovery and physical functional capacity after hip fracture. The intervention included evaluation and modification of environmental hazards, guidance for safe walking, nonpharmacological pain management, a progressive home exercise program, physical activity counseling, and standard care. Measurements: Measurements were outlined according to the tiers of the disablement process, with the ability to negotiate stairs as the main outcome. Prefracture ability to negotiate stairs was enquired at the hospital on average 10 � 5 days after fracture. Subsequently, current perceived ability to negotiate stairs was reported immediately before the intervention (on average 9 weeks after surgery) and 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter.

A total of 360 patients with aesthetic or combined functional aesthetic deficits were included. Validated psychological scales were used as outcome measures. All subjects showed clinically significant levels of appearance-related distress, with highest levels in the aesthetic and lowest levels in the functionally impaired group. Significant gender differences were not found on any psychological measures. A small negative correlation was found between age and distress. These findings challenge the validity of restricting treatment on the basis of an aesthetic distinction, since this is the group demonstrating the highest level of need. Neither age nor gender is a reliable discriminator.

172,"the effects of a family support program and other factors on the home environments provided by adolescent mothers THE EFFECTS OF A FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM AND OTHER FACTORS ON THE HOME ENVIRONMENTS PROVIDED BY ADOLESCENT MOTHERS* Tom Luster, Harry Perlstadt, Marvin McKinney, Kathryn Sims, and Linda Jang** We examine factors related to the quality of the home environments that 83 teenage mothers provide for their 12-month-old infants. The teens and their infants were enrolled in a family support program; teens who received weekly home visits from a family advocate had higher scores on the HOME inventory than those in a comparison group. In addition, the teens who provided relatively supportive environments: (a) were less depressed and more empathic, (b) had infants who were heavier at birth and less irritable at 12 months, (c) received more support from the father of the baby, and (d) lived in safer neighborhoods. This study addresses two questions regarding influences on the parenting behavior of adolescent mothers. First, do adolescent mothers who receive a relatively intensive family support program provide higher quality care for their year-old infants than adolescent mothers who receive less intensive services? Second, what factors other than the family support program are related to the quality of care that adolescent mothers provide for their infants? Approximately 1 out of 10 females between the ages of 15 and 19 becomes pregnant each year, and nearly half of those who become pregnant become parents (Moore, 1995). Research on children born to teen mothers shows that these children tend to do less well than their peers on both cognitive and socialemotional measures (Furstenberg, Brooks-Gunn & Morgan, 1987; Wadsworth, Taylor, Osborn, & Butler, 1984). However, there are marked individual differences among children born to teenage mothers; some do well whereas others do not. Those who are successful in school and exhibit few behavioral problems tend to have mothers who are relatively well adjusted, finish high school, limit further childbearing, and eventually become economically self-sufficient (Furstenberg et al., 1987). More successful children of teenage parents also tend to experience more supportive home environments than peers who are doing less well (Dubow & Luster, 1990). As Furstenberg et al. noted, the life courses of the young mothers and their children seem to be intertwined; successful children tend to have mothers who have coped well with early childbearing and who also provide supportive environments for their children. The Family TIES Support Program Family TIES (Trust, Information, Encouragement, and Support), a family support program, was designed to help teenage mothers cope with early childbearing and to support the development of their children so that the children ultimately arrive at school prepared to succeed in that setting. The specific goals of the program were based on past research on successful outcomes in children born to teenage mothers. The goals included helping the young mothers complete high school and eventually find adequate employment, avoid additional unintended pregnancies, and provide high quality care for their children. The psychological well-being of the young mothers was also emphasized in this program, because the teens ability to nurture their children and to take advantage of services that are available are likely to depend on their psychological adjustment (Schorr, 1988). The design of the program was influenced by what is known from past research about successful family support programs (Olds & Kitzman, 1990; Schorr, 1988). Programs tend to be successful when: (a) the primary person providing the intervention establishes a close relationship with the young mother; (b) the program is long term; (c) case loads are small; (d) the person working with the families is able to cross traditional service delivery boundaries; and (e) the program is ecologically oriented, that is, it focuses on the infant, the mother, the mother s support system, and the larger context rather than on any one of these components. …","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[1.067782250174787e-06, 2.2486243324237876e-05, 4.171197360847145e-05, 0.9995593428611755, 4.440429108854005e-07, 0.017923621460795403, 0.9846137762069702, 6.372873144755431e-07, 0.9999933242797852]"

In this study the religious beliefs and cultural practices of Bangladeshi women were explored to see how they may influence take up of antenatal services. In turn, the boundaries between traditionally “private” (domestic and female) and “public” (wider, professionally defined) spheres were considered, and the implications of this for “control” in pregnancy and childbearing were explored. The difficulty of locating and accessing a “hidden” group was a major methodological consideration. The data collected showed that the women interviewed had attended antenatal clinics, and that whilst some shifts in the boundaries between “private” and “public” spheres were accepted, others had been rejected, and “control” retained.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[8.672321564517915e-05, 0.9999977350234985, 0.0009614973096176982, 0.9999876022338867, 0.9999966621398926, 9.002835213323124e-06, 0.0004195879155304283, 6.149094247120956e-07, 0.0012590691912919283]"
174,"effect of a bicultural community health worker on completion of diabetes education in a hispanic population OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a bicultural community health worker (CHW) on completion of diabetes education in an inner-city Hispanic patient population and to evaluate the impact of completion of the education program on patient knowledge, self-care behaviors, and glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients were randomized into CHW intervention and non-CHW intervention groups. All patients received individualized, comprehensive diabetes education from a certified diabetes nurse educator after baseline demographic information, diabetes knowledge, diabetes self-care practices, and glycohemoglobin levels were assessed. Rates of education program completion were determined. Diabetes knowledge, self-care practices, and glycohemoglobin levels were reassessed at program completion and at a later postprogram follow-up medical appointment and compared to baseline. Logistic regression analysis and the Mantel-Haenszel χ 2 statistic were used to determine the effect of the CHW assignment on program completion. Analyses of covariance were performed with end-of-treatment behavior scores, knowledge scores, and glycohemoglobin levels as outcome variables, controlling for baseline values and testing for the effect of CHW assignment. RESULTS Of 64 patients enrolled in the study, 40 (63%) completed and 24 (37%) dropped out before completing the diabetes education program. Of the patients having CHW intervention, 80% completed the education program, compared with 47% of patients without CHW intervention ( P = 0.01). “Dropouts” were younger (age 47.5 ± 12.5 years [mean ± SD]) compared with patients who completed the program (55.9 ± 9.9 years) ( P = 0.004). Dropout status showed no significant relationship to educational level achieved or literacy level. For the program “completers,” knowledge levels and selected self-care practices significantly improved, and glycohemoglobin levels improved from a baseline level of 11.7% to 9.9% at program completion ( P = 0.004) and 9.5% at the postprogram follow-up ( P P = 0.007). The effect of the CHW on knowledge, self-care behavior, or glycohemoglobin outcome variables was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that intervention with a bicultural CHW improved rates of completion of a diabetes education program in an inner-city Hispanic patient population irrespective of literacy or educational levels attained. Our data further suggests that completion of individualized diabetes educational strategies leads to improved patient knowledge, self-care behaviors, and glycemic control.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[5.44224974419194e-07, 0.9999949932098389, 8.582241207477637e-06, 0.9999833106994629, 3.301927904431068e-07, 0.9999825954437256, 0.9994745850563049, 8.343082527062506e-07, 5.440759878183599e-07]"
175,"long term clinical benefits and costs of an integrated rehabilitation programme compared with outpatient physiotherapy for chronic knee pain Abstract Background Chronic knee pain is a major cause of disability in the elderly. Management guidelines recommend exercise and self-management interventions as effective treatments. The authors previously described a rehabilitation programme integrating exercise and self-management [Enabling Self-management and Coping with Arthritic knee Pain through Exercise (ESCAPE-knee pain)] that produced short-term improvements in pain and physical function, but sustaining these improvements is difficult. Moreover, the programme is untried in clinical environments, where it would ultimately be delivered. Objectives To establish the feasibility of ESCAPE-knee pain and compare its clinical effectiveness and costs with outpatient physiotherapy. Design Pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Setting Outpatient physiotherapy department and community centre. Participants Sixty-four people with chronic knee pain. Interventions Outpatient physiotherapy compared with ESCAPE-knee pain. Outcomes The primary outcome was physical function assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Secondary outcomes included pain, objective functional performance, anxiety, depression, exercise-related health beliefs and healthcare utilisation. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 12 months after completing the interventions (primary endpoint). ANCOVA investigated between-group differences. Results Both groups demonstrated similar improvements in clinical outcomes. Outpatient physiotherapy cost £130 per person and the healthcare utilisation costs of participants over 1 year were £583. The ESCAPE-knee pain programme cost £64 per person and the healthcare utilisation costs of participants over 1 year were £320. Conclusions ESCAPE-knee pain can be delivered as a community-based integrated rehabilitation programme for people with chronic knee pain. Both ESCAPE-knee pain and outpatient physiotherapy produced sustained physical and psychosocial benefits, but ESCAPE-knee pain cost less and was more cost-effective.

178,"education survival and avoidable deaths in cancer patients in finland Relative survival after cancer in Finland is at the highest level observed in Europe and has, in general, been on a steady increase. The aim of this study is to assess whether the high survival is equally shared by different population subgroups and to estimate the possible gains that might be achieved if equity prevailed. The educational level and occupation before the cancer diagnosis of patients diagnosed in Finland in 1971–2005 was derived from an antecedent population census. The cancers were divided into 27 site categories. Cancer (cause)-specific 5-year survival proportions were calculated for three patient categories based on the educational level and for an occupational group of potentially health-conscious patients (physicians, nurses, teachers etc.). Proportions of avoidable deaths were derived by assuming that the patients from the two lower education categories would have the same mortality owing to cancer, as those from the highest educational category. Estimates were also made by additionally assuming that even the mortalities owing to other causes of death were all equal to those in the highest category. For almost all the sites considered, survival was consistently highest for patients with the highest education and lowest for those with only basic education. The potentially health-conscious patients had an even higher survival. The differences were, in part, attributable to less favourable distributions of tumour stages in the lower education categories. In 1996–2005, 4–7% of the deaths in Finnish cancer patients could have potentially been avoided during the first 5-year period after diagnosis, if all the patients had the same cancer mortality as the patients with the highest educational background. The proportion would have also been much higher, 8–11%, if, in addition, the mortality from other causes had been the same as that in the highest educational category. Even in a potentially equitable society with high health care standards, marked inequalities persist in cancer survival.

179,"insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents improvements in key parameters of diabetes management including quality of life Aims To determine the impact of insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) on key parameters of diabetes management including quality of life in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods All patients started on insulin pump therapy were prospectively followed before and after institution of insulin pump therapy. Data collected included age, duration of diabetes, glycated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c), anthropometric data and episodes of severe hypoglycaemia defined as hypoglycaemia resulting in coma or convulsion. A subset of patients also completed the Diabetes Quality of Life Instrument (DQOL) and Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Scale (SED) questionnaires to assess quality of life. Results At the time of analysis, 100 patients had been managed with insulin pump therapy. The mean age when starting pump therapy was 12.5 (3.9–19.6) years. Duration of therapy ranged from 0.2 to 4.0 years (mean 1.4 years, median 1.5 years). HbA1c decreased from 8.3 ± 0.1% prior to pump therapy to 7.8 ± 0.1% (P < 0.0001). Episodes of severe hypoglycaemia decreased from 32.9 to 11.4 per 100 patient years. Components of quality of life measures showed improvement on pump treatment. BMI standard deviation scores (z scores) did not increase. Conclusions Pump therapy is proving an effective means of insulin therapy in the young patient that shows promise to improve glycaemic control with a reduction in hypoglycaemia frequency. Quality of Life measures suggest that psychosocial outcomes may be improved.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 0.0038475042674690485, 0.9768352508544922, 0.9999754428863525, 3.3062070770029095e-07, 2.0148004296061117e-06, 1.6551094859096338e-06, 7.284812681973563e-07, 5.648659566759306e-07]"
180,"a risky treat exploring parental perceptions of the barriers to seating their children in the rear seats of passenger vehicles Background: Sitting in the rear seat of a vehicle rather than in the front seat reduces children’s risk of injury or death by ⩾35% in the event of a crash. As road trauma is a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality in highly motorised nations, even in countries where restraint use is high, encouraging parents to place children in the rear seats of vehicles offers a low-cost avenue to improving children’s overall health. However, little is known about the factors that affect parents’ decisions about seating positions. Objective: To explore parental perceptions of barriers to placing their children in the rear seat of passenger vehicles whenever possible. Design and subjects: Focus group discussions were held with urban parent-drivers to elicit their concerns about children’s car safety and barriers to rear-seat use. Results: Most parents had a rule that children should sit in the rear seat. Parents said that they relaxed these rules for a variety of reasons including social pressure, perceptions of the trip as short and because children regard sitting in the front seat as a treat. Parenting style, child cooperativeness, social pressure and inability to justify the risk of injury were identified as barriers to rear-seat travel. Conclusions: Effective interventions to increase the proportion of children travelling in the rear seat should address parents’ experiences of pressure to relax seating rules and risk perception, as well as provide strategies that support sound parental safety decisions.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999983310699463, 1.2349710232228972e-05, 7.509215356549248e-05, 0.999991774559021, 3.6688035720544576e-07, 0.001242549973540008, 0.9999967813491821, 1.049683987730532e-06, 9.442289297112438e-07]"
181,"use of a web 2 0 portal to improve education and communication in young patients with families randomized controlled trial Background: Diabetes requires extensive self-care and comprehensive knowledge, making patient education central to diabetes self-management. Web 2.0 systems have great potential to enhance health information and open new ways for patients and practitioners to communicate. Objective: To develop a Web portal designed to facilitate self-management, including diabetes-related information and social networking functions, and to study its use and effects in pediatric patients with diabetes. Methods: A Web 2.0 portal was developed in collaboration with patients, parents, and practitioners. It offered communication with local practitioners, interaction with peers, and access to relevant information and services. Children and adolescents with diabetes in a geographic population of two pediatric clinics in Sweden were randomized to a group receiving passwords for access to the portal or a control group with no access (n=230) for 1 year. All subjects had access during a second study year. Users’ activity was logged by site and page visits. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL), empowerment (DES), and quality of information (QPP) questionnaires were given at baseline and after 1 and 2 study years. Clinical data came from the Swedish pediatric diabetes quality registry SWEDIABKIDS. Results: There was a continuous flow of site visits, decreasing in summer and Christmas periods. In 119/233 families (51%), someone visited the portal the first study year and 169/484 (35%) the second study year. The outcome variables did not differ between intervention and control group. No adverse treatment or self-care effects were identified. A higher proportion of mothers compared to fathers visited once or more the first year ( P <.001) and the second year ( P <.001). The patients who had someone in the family visiting the portal 5 times or more, had shorter diabetes duration ( P =.006), were younger ( P =.008), had lower HbA1c after 1 year of access (P= .010), and were more often girls (P< .001). Peer interaction seems to be a valued aspect. Conclusions: The Web 2.0 portal may be useful as a complement to traditional care for this target group. Widespread use of a portal would need integration in routine care and promotion by diabetes team members.

The goal of this study was to pilot test the scope, acceptability, and efficacy of an educational videotape and tailored TKR decision aid designed to reduce disparities in TKR knowledge and expectations. Methods African American and Caucasian male veteran volunteers ages 55–85 years with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) were recruited. During group meetings, patients viewed a video about knee OA treatments and were provided a personalized arthritis report that presented predicted patient outcomes should they decide to undergo TKR. Patients completed baseline and postintervention questionnaires that included an adapted Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) instrument to measure post-TKR expectations (0–100 scale with higher scores reflecting poorer outcomes). Results A total of 102 patients (54 African American, 48 Caucasian) completed the baseline survey and 64 patients attended the intervention. There were no significant differences by race between patients completing and those dropping out of the study. At baseline (n = 102), African American patients expressed lower expectations about post-TKR outcomes than did Caucasian patients for both pain (WOMAC score 41 versus 34; P = 0.18) and physical function expectations (WOMAC score 38 versus 30; P = 0.13). Among African Americans who underwent the intervention, expected pain and physical function improved to 31 (P = 0.04 versus baseline) and 30 (P = 0.09 versus baseline), respectively. Caucasian patients expectations changed little.

However, questions about long-term efficacy of insulin pump therapy still remain. We evaluated the long-term efficacy of continuous insulin infusion pump therapy (CSII) in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: This was a retrospective observational study which included 131 patients with T1DM who transitioned to an insulin pump from multiple daily insulin (MDI) injections between 1999 and 2009 and were followed by one endocrinologist. Data were collected from 6 months prior to switching to CSII to 30 months after initiation of CSII and included glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin requirement. Of the 131 patients, 45 had complete data consisting of a visit and HbA1c every 6 months for 30 months after transition to CSII and were included for analysis. Results: Mean HbA1c prior to starting the CSII was 8.0 +0.9 %, 7.7 +1.0 % at 6 months and 7.8+1.2 % at 1 yr post initiation of CSII. However, at 30 months, HbA1c increased to 8.0+1.3%. A trend in transient improvement in HbA1c was limited only to those patients >11 yr of age and those requiring >0.75 u/kg/day of insulin at transition and was not seen in those <11 yr of age or those requiring <0.75 u/kg/day and did not persist beyond 1 year.

186,"differences in citation rates by country of origin for papers published in top ranked medical journals do they reflect inequalities in access to publication Background The acceptance of a paper in a top-ranked journal depends on the importance of the study, and should not depend on its country of origin. If the papers9 citation rate is a proxy for their importance, and the threshold for acceptance is unrelated to the country of origin, papers from different countries published in the same journal should have a similar number of citations. Conversely, if the threshold is lowered for some countries, their papers will have a lower mean citation rate. Methods The number of citations and the corresponding author9s country were obtained for 4724 papers published between 1998 and 2002 in the British Medical Journal , the Lancet , Journal of the American Medical Association and New England Journal of Medicine . Countries were grouped according to the World Bank classification and geographical location: low–middle income countries; high-income European countries; high-income non-European countries; UK and USA. The probability of papers being poorly cited by country of origin was estimated, using domestic papers (British papers published in British journals and US papers published in US journals) as the reference. Results Compared with domestic papers, the OR of being poorly cited was 0.67 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81) for papers from high-income European countries, 0.97 (0.76 to 1.24) for papers from high-income non-European countries and 1.93 (1.28 to 2.89) for papers from low–middle income countries.

Research design and methods: Thirty type 1 diabetic adolescents at CSII and 26 matched MDI controls were included in this open intention-to-treat study. Actrapid was used in both groups. Before study entry, all participants followed a brush-up course in order to minimize study effect. At each visit, the following parameters were recorded: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin dose, weight, number of hypoglycemic and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events, and the time resources used. At entry and exit of the study, diet registration and validated quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires were filled by the participants. Results: A non-significant decline in HbA1c was seen in both groups (p = 0.468); HbA1c decreased from 9.5 to 8.9% and from 9.7 to 9.5% in the CSII and MDI group, respectively. The insulin dose and the number of severe hypoglycemic events per patient were lower (non-significant) in the CSII group. Both groups showed increased body mass index – highest in the CSII group – and mild to moderate DKA episodes were only seen among CSII users. No differences could be demonstrated within the QoL or diet registrations. Conclusions: CSII treatment is beneficial as an intensified insulin therapy for selected type 1 diabetic patients and both MDI and CSII can be offered by the professional diabetes team to better tailor therapy.

191,disadvantaged single teenage mothers and their children consequences of free educational day care The benefits of providing free educational day care from birth to children of 29 single US teenage mothers were examined in a 4 1/2 year longitudinal study. An analysis of the data indicates that the children benefitted intellectually from the program scoring significantly higher than controls on a general cognitive index. Mothers had an increased likelihood of completing high school obtaining post-secondary training and becoming self-supporting. The mothers in both the experimental and control groups had access to the same basic set of community resources. They attended the same secondary schools had access to the same college and vocational school system and had the same resources for low cost medical care for themselves. Thus it was concluded that easy access to good day care service beginning in their childs infancy was probably an important factor in the differential success rate of the experimental group. Because assignment to the intervention condition was random the present study is free from any bias obtained in those studies where highly motivated parents self-select day care.

192,"pilot multimethod trial of a school ethos intervention to reduce substance use building hypotheses about upstream pathways to prevention Purpose: Interventions to improve school ethos can reduce substance use but “upstream” causal pathways relating to implementation and school-level changes are uncertain. We use qualitative and quantitative data from a pilot trial to build hypotheses regarding these. Methods: The Healthy School Ethos intervention involved two schools being provided with facilitation, training, and funding to plan and implement actions (some mandatory and some locally determined) to improve school ethos over one year. The evaluation involved a pilot-trial with two intervention and two comparison schools; semi-structured interviews with facilitators, staff, and students; and baseline and follow-up surveys with students aged 11 to 12 years. Results: Student accounts linked participation in planning or delivering intervention activities with improved self-regard and relationships with staff and other students. Some activities such as re-writing school rules involved broad participation. Students in receipt of actions such as peer-mediation or motivational sessions reported benefits such as improved safety and relationships. Some student accounts linked improved self-regard and relationships with increased engagement and aspirations, and reduced substance use. At 9-month follow-up, students in intervention schools reported less hurting and teasing of others and feeling unsafe at school. Other outcomes suggested intervention benefits but were not significant. Conclusions: School-ethos interventions may reduce substance use through upstream pathways involving the aforementioned factors. Future phase-III trials should quantitatively model the extent to which these mediate intervention effects.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[2.2344509034155635e-06, 0.5613756775856018, 8.083407010417432e-06, 9.891765330394264e-06, 3.284456795427104e-07, 0.9985840320587158, 9.371328815177549e-07, 4.956359589414205e-07, 4.166919461567886e-05]"

197,"it s good to talk adolescent perspectives of an informal peer led intervention to reduce smoking Although peer education has enjoyed considerable popularity as a health promotion approach with young people, there is mixed evidence about its effectiveness. Furthermore, accounts of what young people actually do as peer educators are scarce, especially in informal settings. In this paper, we examine the activities of the young people recruited as ‘peer supporters’ for A Stop Smoking in Schools Trial (ASSIST) which involved 10,730 students at baseline in 59 secondary schools in south-east Wales and the west of England. Influential Year 8 students, nominated by their peers, were trained to intervene informally to reduce smoking levels in their year group. The ASSIST peer nomination procedure was successful in recruiting and retaining peer supporters of both genders with a wide range of abilities. Outcome data at 1-year follow-up indicate that the risk of students who were occasional or experimental smokers at baseline going on to report weekly smoking at 1-year follow-up was 18.2% lower in intervention schools. This promising result was supported by analysis of salivary cotinine. Qualitative data from the process evaluation indicate that the majority of peer supporters adopted a pragmatic approach, concentrating their attentions on friends and peers whom they felt could be persuaded not to take up smoking, rather than those they considered to be already ‘addicted’ or who were members of smoking cliques. ASSIST demonstrated that a variety of school-based peer educators, who are asked to work informally rather than under the supervision of teaching staff, will engage with the task they have been asked to undertake and can be effective in diffusing health-promotion messages. Given the serious concerns about young people s smoking behaviour, we argue that this approach is worth pursuing and could be adapted for other health promotion messages.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999953508377075, 0.9999985694885254, 8.07519336376572e-06, 2.2394693587557413e-05, 3.6248192714083416e-07, 0.004100800026208162, 0.0007656730595044792, 5.958082738288795e-07, 5.985367579341982e-07]"

Paraprofessionals were women who had been on public assistance and successfully attained health and human services for themselves and their infants. They were similar to the patients they served in educational background and ethnicity. A six-week training program prepared them to counsel and assist pregnant women with health and social services, housing, food, transportation and other basic necessities. Women attending a publically-funded prenatal clinic were randomly assigned to a paraprofessional. A comparison group matched for ethnicity, parity and trimester entering prenatal care was also selected. Women followed by a paraprofessional had significantly more prenatal appointments (8.0 vs 6.5 visits) and infants with average higher birthweight (3125 grams) over the matched comparison group (3273 grams). While intensity of contact with a paraprofessional contributed significantly to the amount of prenatal care received by patients of paraprofessionals, the mechanism for improvement in birthweight is unknown.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[9.258616842089396e-07, 0.9999959468841553, 0.000908931193407625, 5.6384888011962175e-06, 3.642864214725705e-07, 1.075547970685875e-05, 0.9999990463256836, 9.473551472183317e-07, 0.04685131087899208]"

Methods 48 paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (22 using an insulin pump) underwent an ambulatory 3-day continuous glucose monitoring. All patients continued with normal daily activities and collected urine for two consecutive 24 h periods. The glucose pentagon was used to calculate the glycaemic risk parameter. Results Insulin requirements, HDL-cholesterol, the mean of glycaemic excursions (P < 001) and the standard deviation of mean glucose concentration (P < 005) were significantly lower in patients with CSII compared with those using MDI. By contrast, averaged HbA1c during the last twelve months as well as at the time of sensor insertion did not differ significantly between both groups. Summarizing characteristic parameter of acute and long-term metabolic control into the glucose pentagon revealed a significantly lower glycaemic risk parameter in CSI patients compared with both, healthy subjects and patients using MDI (P < 005).

202,"diversity in the biomedical research workforce developing talent Much has been written about the need for and barriers to achievement of greater diversity in the biomedical workforce from the perspectives of gender, race and ethnicity; this is not a new topic. These discussions often center around a ‘pipeline metaphor’ which imagines students flowing through a series of experiences to eventually arrive at a science career. Here we argue that diversity will only be achieved if the primary focus is on: what is happening within the pipeline, not just counting individuals entering and leaving it; de-emphasizing achieving academic milestones by ‘typical’ ages; and adopting approaches that most effectively develop talent. Students may develop skills at different rates based on factors such as earlier access to educational resources, exposure to science (especially research experiences), and competing demands for time and attention during high school and college. Therefore, there is wide variety among students at any point along the pipeline. Taking this view requires letting go of imagining the pipeline as a sequence of age-dependent steps in favor of milestones of skill and talent development decoupled from age or educational stage. Emphasizing talent development opens up many new approaches for science training outside of traditional degree programs. This article provides examples of such approaches, including interventions at the post-baccalaureate and PhD levels, as well as a novel coaching model that incorporates well-established social science theories and complements traditional mentoring. These approaches could significantly impact diversity by developing scientific talent, especially among currently underrepresented minorities.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[4.791336891685205e-07, 0.999998927116394, 3.3363558031851426e-05, 0.9999408721923828, 3.626433908721083e-07, 1.8112269799530623e-06, 8.384118928006501e-07, 6.011757136548113e-07, 6.757161941095546e-07]"

Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is difficult, and methods to increase it are needed. Methods. We tested the impact of supportive telephone calls in an adherence substudy of a treatment trial. Subjects initiating antiretroviral therapy received either each site s usual adherence support measures or usual support measures and scripted serial telephone calls (16 calls during 96 weeks). Results. A total of 282 subjects enrolled: 140 in the usual support measures group and 142 in the calls group. A total of 75% of expected calls were completed.

205,"multi micronutrient fortified biscuits decreased the prevalence of anaemia and improved iron status whereas weekly iron supplementation only improved iron status in vietnamese school children In Vietnam, nutrition interventions do not target school children despite a high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies. The present randomised, placebo-controlled study evaluated the impact of providing school children (n 403) with daily multiple micronutrient-fortified biscuits (FB) or a weekly Fe supplement (SUP) on anaemia and Fe deficiency. Micronutrient status was assessed by concentrations of Hb, and plasma ferritin (PF), transferrin receptor (TfR), Zn and retinol. After 6 months of intervention, children receiving FB or SUP had a significantly better Fe status when compared with the control children (C), indicated by higher PF (FB: geometric mean 36·9 (95 % CI 28·0, 55·4) μg/l; SUP: geometric mean 46·0 (95 % CI 33·0, 71·7) μg/l; C: geometric mean 34·4 (95 % CI 15·2, 51·2) μg/l; P < 0·001) and lower TfR concentrations (FB: geometric mean 5·7 (95 % CI 4·8, 6·52) mg/l; SUP: geometric mean 5·5 (95 % CI 4·9, 6·2) mg/l; C: geometric mean 5·9 (95 % CI 5·1, 7·1) mg/l; P = 0·007). Consequently, body Fe was higher in children receiving FB (mean 5·6 (sd 2·2) mg/kg body weight) and SUP (mean 6·1 (sd 2·5) mg/kg body weight) compared with the C group (mean 4·2 (sd 3·3) mg/kg body weight, P < 0·001). However, anaemia prevalence was significantly lower only in the FB group (1·0 %) compared with the C group (10·4 %, P = 0·006), with the SUP group being intermediate (7·4 %). Children receiving FB had better weight-for-height Z-scores after the intervention than children receiving the SUP (P = 0·009). Vitamin A deficiency at baseline modified the intervention effect, with higher Hb concentrations in vitamin A-deficient children receiving FB but not in those receiving the SUP. This indicates that vitamin A deficiency is implicated in the high prevalence of anaemia in Vietnamese school children, and that interventions should take other deficiencies besides Fe into account to improve Hb concentrations. Provision of biscuits fortified with multiple micronutrients is effective in reducing anaemia prevalence in school children.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999995231628418, 1.9389865428820485e-06, 0.00018612101848702878, 0.9999916553497314, 3.954646388137917e-07, 0.00042095122626051307, 0.9999961853027344, 0.0004063291708007455, 6.318167038443789e-07]"
206,"racial disparities among clinical research investigators Evidence shows that minority patients are underrepresented in clinical trials. The development of new drugs and treatments, however, requires that clinical research studies include representative participants, particularly in light of evidence indicating that minority populations sometimes respond differently to prescription medications. Racial disparities among clinical investigators are often cited as a major reason why minority patients are underrepresented in clinical trials. However, there is little to no empirical data to support or refute the prevalence of disparities among clinical investigators. The Tufts Center conducted two online surveys of 1376 physicians. The first survey (N = 859 respondents; 31% response rate) assessed the overall incidence of minority physician involvement in clinical research. The second survey (N = 768 respondents; 20% response rate) assessed the demographics, experience, and infrastructure of minority physicians who have participated in clinical research as a principal investigator or subinvestigator. The results of this study indicate that significant racial disparities exist among clinical investigators. The results also support assertions that physician race influences race of the clinical trial volunteer. The incidence of participation in clinical research among minority physicians is well below that observed among white physicians, more so with regard to U.S. Food & Drug Administration-regulated clinical trials funded by industry. Minority investigators tend to conduct and initiate fewer clinical trials annually. Yet minority and white physician interest in participating in clinical research is similarly high. Minority investigators tend be younger, with more limited clinical research infrastructure and support than their white counterparts. New strategies, policies, incentives, and reforms are needed to address racial disparities among clinical investigators. In addition, disparities among both volunteers and investigators need to be tracked more closely and methodically to monitor and assess the impact of newly implemented programs and reforms.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[4.923983283333655e-07, 0.9999722242355347, 1.2145361324655823e-05, 0.8968167901039124, 6.917661039551604e-07, 3.6766180073755095e-06, 2.679698809515685e-06, 6.292262924034731e-07, 1.2055407978550647e-06]"
207,"understanding predictors of functional recovery and outcome 30 months following early childhood head injury Much is known about outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in school-age children; however, recovery in early childhood is less well understood. Some argue that such injuries should lead to good outcome, because of the plasticity of the developing brain. Other purport that the young brain is vulnerable, with injury likely to result in a substantial impairment (H. G. Taylor & J. Alden, 1997). The aim of this study was to examine outcomes following TBI during early childhood, to plot recovery over the 30 months postinjury, and to identify predictors of outcome. The study compared 3 groups of children sustaining mild, moderate, and severe TBI, ages 2.0 to 6.11 years at injury, with healthy controls. Groups were comparable for preinjury adaptive and behavioral function, psychosocial characteristics, age, and gender. Results suggested a strong association between injury severity and outcomes across all domains. Further, 30-month outcome was predicted by injury severity, family factors, and preinjury levels of child function. In conclusion, children with more severe injuries and lower preinjury adaptive abilities, and whose families are coping poorly, are at greatest risk of long-term impairment in day-to-day skills, even several years postinjury.","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[6.278189061958983e-07, 2.3009979486232623e-06, 1.54405934154056e-05, 0.9999899864196777, 3.6922784829585e-07, 0.9261140823364258, 0.9999990463256836, 8.49766138344421e-07, 6.857546850369545e-07]"
208,"supermum superwife supereverything performing femininity in the transition to motherhood The aim of this qualitative study was to comprehend how mothers understood and accounted for their experiences in relation to the ideology of motherhood which has been socially constructed as a critical aspect of femininity. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 24 primiparous and multiparous women, and transcripts analysed using open and axial coding with triangulation. Using a material‐discursive approach to interpret the data, two higher order themes are presented: ‘the realization of new motherhood’ and ‘coping with new motherhood’. These themes demonstrate how unprepared for motherhood the women were and how their expectations were based on various myths of motherhood. This led to feelings of inadequacy as they struggled with the myth versus reality discrepancy. However, they could not be seen to be inadequate and therefore employed greater efforts to portray themselves as supermum, superwife, supereverything and hide the opposite.

209,"goal desires moderate intention behaviour relations Models such as the Extended Model of Goal-Directed Behaviour and the Theory of Planned Behaviour imply that the impact of one s goals on behaviour is mediated by more proximal determinants. We hypothesize that goals can have a broader and more dynamic impact on behaviour and, specifically, that goal desires can moderate the effect of intentions on behaviour. Four studies addressed this issue by examining the direct and moderated effects of goal desires on behaviour. All of the studies required participants to complete baseline measures and then a follow-up indicator of behaviour. In Study 1 (N=119) that focused on fruit intake, Study 2 (N=123) and Study 3 (N=96) concerned with drinking alcohol and Study 4 (N=109) regarding snack consumption, behavioural intentions were more reliably related to behaviour when goal desires were strong. The results of Study 3 suggested that goal desire stability increases the likelihood of this moderator effect emerging and Study 4 revealed that this effect was not suppressed by intention stability. The findings suggest that goals and behavioural intentions can operate simultaneously and jointly influence action, a view that contradicts predictions that the effects of goals are fully mediated by more proximal behavioural determinants.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999995231628418, 0.9999920129776001, 1.6962825611699373e-05, 1.1825127330666874e-05, 3.703372897234658e-07, 0.999985933303833, 1.4270674455474364e-06, 5.264507763058646e-07, 5.89540604778449e-07]"
210,"a bridge to insulin pump therapy twice daily regimen with nph and detemir insulins during initial treatment of youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus OBJECTIVE To describe clinical outcomes in youth with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated with a modified, twice-daily regimen of a mixture of NPH insulin and rapid-acting insulin analogue at breakfast and separate injections of rapid-acting insulin analogue and insulin detemir at dinner. METHODS Our clinic database was used to describe changes in insulin doses, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) levels, and frequency of severe hypoglycemia during the first year of therapy in young patients with T1DM diagnosed between September 2006 and April 2009. Data are presented as median values (25%, 75%). RESULTS Overall, 108 patients (62 girls; mean age, 10.0 ± 0.4 years) were eligible for inclusion. Total daily insulin doses at 3, 6, and 12 months were 0.6 (0.4, 0.8), 0.7 (0.4, 0.9), and 0.8 (0.6, 0.9) U/kg, respectively. A1C levels were 9.8% (8.5%, 10.8%) at 2 weeks (baseline). Of the 108 patients, 19 had switched to insulin pump therapy by 3 months and 49 had switched by 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1DM. The 49 pump-treated patients had an A1C of 6.9% (6.6%, 7.3%), whereas the 59 injection-treated patients had an A1C of 7.2% (6.7%, 7.7%) by 12 months. There were only 6 severe hypoglycemic events in 5 patients; none occurred during the first 3 months, none occurred during the night, and all occurred in patients receiving insulin injection treatment. CONCLUSION A twice-daily insulin regimen that uses insulin detemir for overnight basal replacement and morning NPH insulin to avoid lunch and afternoon snack doses is an effective initial treatment for young patients with new-onset T1DM that can provide a smooth transition to intensive basal/bolus insulin pump therapy.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 0.00014191695663612336, 0.00017330388072878122, 0.9999712705612183, 3.6147048376733437e-07, 3.1219824450090528e-06, 8.976541721494868e-05, 1.072688519343501e-06, 8.143723562170635e-07]"
211,"rural urban comparisons of nursing home residents with multiple sclerosis Context Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurologic disease that disables younger adults, affecting as many as 350,000 Americans. Purpose The objectives of this study are to develop profiles of nursing home residents with MS from rural areas and compare them to residents with MS who lived in urban areas, suburban areas, and large towns. Methods We analyzed all admission assessments for residents with MS (13,357 assessments) in the Minimum Data Set between June 23, 1998, and December 31, 2000, that also had the resident s ZIP code of primary residence before admission. Findings Urban and rural comparisons of residents with MS demonstrate a range of significant demographic differences. Significantly greater proportions of MS residents from rural areas exhibited a sense of initiative or involvement in activities of the nursing facility compared with residents with MS from urban and suburban areas. The differences in the utilization of physical and occupational therapies were striking, with MS residents from rural areas averaging significantly fewer minutes of these therapies. We also found that MS residents from rural areas averaged fewer minutes of psychological therapy in the nursing facility and also were less likely to have seen a licensed mental health specialist than MS residents from urban areas. Conclusions Nursing home residents with MS from rural areas receive fewer therapies and less mental health care than residents with MS from other areas.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999992847442627, 1.2685691217484418e-06, 8.877846084942576e-06, 6.161072633403819e-06, 3.7661510532416287e-07, 1.5798077583895065e-06, 1.1036459000024479e-05, 8.140236218423524e-07, 2.907684029196389e-05]"
212,"management of multiple sclerosis across managed care and fee for service systems Objective: To measure and compare care for adults with MS across managed care and fee-for-service (FFS) health systems. Methods: The authors sampled adults with MS having physician visits over a 2-year period from a group model health maintenance organization (HMO) in southern California, from a midwestern independent practice association (IPA) model managed care plan, and from the FFS portion of the practices of a random sample of southern California neurologists. The authors mailed surveys to subjects in mid-1996; 930 of 1,164 (80%) of those eligible responded. The authors measured sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, management of recent changes in mobility, bladder control, and fatigue, use of a disease-modifying agent, assessment of general health symptoms and issues, and unmet information needs. The authors adjusted comparisons between systems for comorbidity, disease severity, and disease type. Results: The groups differed on most sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. There were few differences in symptom management; differences that did exist tended toward more referrals or treatment for the FFS group. Access to the disease-modifying agent available at the time of the survey did not differ across systems, although patients’ perceptions of the rationale for not using the drug did vary. General health issues and symptoms were more often assessed in the FFS and IPA systems than in the HMO, but improvement was needed across all three systems of care. There were substantial unmet information needs in all groups and especially high ones in the FFS and HMO samples. Conclusions: Strategies to improve care for people with MS should be developed and evaluated, particularly in areas like symptom assessment and meeting patient information needs. Where variations in service delivery exist, longitudinal studies are also needed to evaluate the potential impact on outcomes and to evaluate reasons for variation.","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999912977218628, 2.972692709590774e-05, 2.3951562980073504e-05, 0.9844825863838196, 3.452371117873554e-07, 8.550323400413617e-06, 1.1891528401974938e-06, 1.5468510810023872e-06, 0.0031432511750608683]"
213,"assessing gender balance among journal authors and editorial board members The study of journal authorship and editorial board membership from a gender perspective is addressed in this paper following international recommendations about the need to obtain science and technology indicators by gender. Authorship informs us about active scientists who contribute to the production and dissemination of new knowledge through journal articles, while editorial board membership tells us about leading scientists who have obtained scientific recognition within the scientific community. This study analyses by gender the composition of the editorial boards of 131 high-quality Spanish journals in all fields of science, the presence of men and women as authors in a selection of 36 journals, and the evolution of these aspects from 1998 to 2009. Female presence is lower than male presence in authorship, editorial board membership and editorship. The presence of female authors is slightly lower than the presence of women in the Spanish Higher Education sector and doubles female presence in editorial boards, which mirrors female presence in the highest academic rank. The gender gap tends to diminish over the years in most areas, especially in authorship and very slightly in editorial board membership. Large editorial boards and having a female editor-in-chief are positively correlated with women presence in editorial boards. The situation of women in Spanish science is further assessed in an international context analysing a selection of international reference journals. The usefulness of journal-based indicators to monitor the situation of men and women in science and to assess the success of policies oriented to enhance gender equality in science is finally discussed.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[6.770831078029005e-07, 9.786306236492237e-07, 1.0393183401902206e-05, 0.9999933242797852, 3.546687139532878e-07, 2.3231643808685476e-06, 7.781778208482137e-07, 6.220711270543688e-07, 6.544921689055627e-07]"

Cambridge Public Schools (CPS) have monitored BMI and fitness annually since 2000. Annual increases of overweight and obesity from 2000 (37.0%) to 2004 (39.1%), triggered a multidisciplinary team of researchers, educators, health care, and public health professionals to mobilize environmental and policy interventions. Guided by the social-ecological model and community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles, the team developed and implemented Healthy Living Cambridge Kids (HLCK), a multicomponent intervention targeting community, school, family, and individuals. The intervention included city policies and community awareness campaigns; physical education (PE) enhancements, food service reforms, farm-to-school-to-home programs; and family outreach and BMI and fitness reports . Baseline (2004) to follow-up (2007) evaluation design assessed change in children s weight and fitness status. A cohort of 1,858 K-5th grade children participated: 37.3% black, 14.0% Hispanic, 37.1% white, 10.2% Asian, 1.7% other race; 43.3% were lower income.

From our previous clinical work with overweight/obese youth, we identified the need for research to create an effective weight management intervention to address the growing prevalence of adolescent metabolic syndrome. Formative assessment through an adaptive community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach was conducted toward the development of a nutritional and physical activity (DVD) and clinician toolkit for a school-based health center (SBHC) weight management intervention. Methods. We first conducted parent and adolescent interviews on views and experiences about obesity while convening a community advisory council (CAC) recruited from two participating urban New Mexico high schools. Thematic findings from the interviews were analyzed with the CAC to develop culturally and developmentally appropriate intervention materials. Results. Themes from the parent and adolescent interviews included general barriers/challenges, factors influencing motivation, and change facilitators. The CAC and university-based research team reached consensus on the final content of nutrition and physical activity topics to produce a DVD and clinician toolkit through six monthly sessions. These materials used in the SBHC intervention resulted in a greater reduction of body mass index when compared to adolescents receiving standard care. Conclusions.

METHODS: Double-blind randomized controlled trial comprised of children aged 2 to 6 years with initial hemoglobin exceeding 9 g/dL from four not-for-profit daycares randomly selected in the city of Sao Paulo - Brazil. Children of 2 daycares (n = 88) received rolls with fortified wheat flour as the exposed group (EC) and children of 2 daycares (n = 85) received rolls without fortification as the control group (CG) over a 24-week period. Rolls with 4 mg iron each were offered once a day, five days a week. Hemoglobin concentrations were determined in capillary blood by HemoCue® at three moments of trial: baseline (Ml), after 12 and 24 weeks of intervention (M2, M3). RESULTS: Hemoglobin concentration presented significant increase up to M3 in EG (11.7-12.5-12.6 g/dL) and in CG (11.1-12.4-12.3 g/dL) with higher elevations in children initially with anemia. There was significant reduction in the occurrence of anemia from 22% to 9% in EG and from 47% to 8.2% in CG at M3.

221,"inequalities in bariatric surgery in australia findings from 49 364 obese participants in a prospective cohort study OBJECTIVES To investigate variation, and quantify socioeconomic inequalities, in the uptake of primary bariatric surgery in an obese population. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective population-based cohort study of 49,364 individuals aged 45-74 years with body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg/m2. Data from questionnaires (distributed from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008) were linked to hospital and death data to 30 June 2010. The sample was drawn from the 45 and Up Study (approximately 10% of New South Wales population aged 45 included, response rate approximately 18%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of bariatric surgery and adjusted rate ratios (RRs) in relation to health and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS Over 111,757 person-years (py) of follow-up, 312 participants had bariatric surgery, a rate of 27.92 per 10,000 py (95% CI, 24.91-31.19). Rates were highest in women, those living in major cities and those with diabetes, and increased significantly with a higher BMI and number of chronic health conditions. Adjusted RRs were 5.27 (95% CI, 3.18-8.73) for those with annual household income≥ $70 000 versus those with household income<$20,000, and 4.01 (95% CI, 2.41-6.67) for those living in areas in the least disadvantaged quintile versus those in the most disadvantaged quintile. Having versus not having private health insurance (age- and sex-adjusted RR, 9.25; 95% CI, 5.70-15.00) partially explained the observed inequalities. CONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery has been shown to be cost-effective in treating severe obesity and associated illnesses. While bariatric surgery rates in Australia are higher in those with health problems, large socioeconomic inequalities are apparent. Our findings suggest these procedures are largely available to those who can afford private health insurance and associated out-of-pocket costs, with poor access in populations who are most in need. Continuing inequalities in access are likely to exacerbate existing inequalities in obesity and related health problems.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9931368827819824, 2.593891622382216e-06, 7.926199032226577e-06, 0.9999752044677734, 3.4075449661941093e-07, 1.0367306458647363e-05, 0.9999983310699463, 4.6397835262723675e-07, 8.765130701249291e-07]"
222,"assessing the impact of a school based latrine cleaning and handwashing program on pupil absence in nyanza province kenya a cluster randomized trial Improving school water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions reduces pupil absence and illness. However, these benefits may depend on the conditions of the latrines and availability of consumables. We sought to determine whether a low-cost, policy-relevant, environmental-level latrine cleaning intervention could improve latrine cleanliness, increase its use and reduce absenteeism. methods In a three-arm, cluster-randomized trial we assessed absence via periodical roll-call among 17 564 pupils in 60 schools that had previously received WASH improvements as part of the SWASH+ project. Latrine conditions and use were also assessed using structured observation. Latrine cleanliness increased significantly during the post-intervention period among schools receiving the latrine cleaning package compared to controls, as did handwashing with soap. We found no difference in latrine use and absence across arms. The additive impact of cleaning may not have been strong enough to impact absence above and beyond reductions attributable to the original WASH infrastructure improvements and basic hygiene education the schools previously received. Improving latrine conditions is important for the dignity and well-being of pupils, and investments and strategies are necessary to ensure that school toilets are clean and pupil-friendly.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999992847442627, 1.4649904187535867e-06, 0.21063947677612305, 4.183578857919201e-05, 3.4526476611063117e-07, 0.9999979734420776, 8.908716154110152e-06, 8.126360739879601e-07, 6.741078095728881e-07]"
223,"multiple daily injections in young patients using the ezy bicc bolus insulin calculation card compared to mixed insulin and csii Objective: To describe the easy bolus insulin calculation card (ezy-BICC) approach to multiple daily injections and to compare in an observational study, the haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) achieved while using ezy-BICC, mixed insulin injections and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Methods: HbA1c results from 7121 clinic visits by 573 patients aged 1–20 yr using the three methods between June 2000 and July 2008 were reviewed. Results: For mixed insulin median, mean and SD HbA1c were 8.3%, 8.3%, 1.33, for ezy-BICC, 7.6%, 7.7%, 1.40, and for CSII, 7.6%, 7.8%, 1.31. HbA1c increases with age significantly more in those using CSII (p 12 yr, HbA1c is lower while using ezy-BICC than CSII. HbA1c increases 0.2% per yr following diagnosis for 2.8 yr. In those who change from mixed insulin to ezy-BICC after this time, the mean HbA1c is 0.5% lower by 9 months, 0.7% lower at 21 months and 0.6% lower at 24 months (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The ezy-BICC system is inexpensive and convenient and allows patients to vary meal size. Subjects achieve lower HbA1c while using CSII and ezy-BICC MDI than with mixed insulin. Very young subjects achieve excellent HbA1c using CSII, but for 12 to 20 yr-old patients, ezy-BICC results in lower HbA1c than CSII for a lower cost.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 8.175051107173203e-07, 9.366644007968716e-06, 0.9999830722808838, 3.596689452933788e-07, 2.6141960915992968e-06, 1.2153356010458083e-06, 8.322182338815765e-07, 5.232863031778834e-07]"

The resulting knowledge gap compromises efforts for physical therapy service planning for this population. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the use of and need for physical therapy services in a sample of adults with MS living in the Midwestern United States. Design This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study. Methods Data from telephone interviews with 1,065 people with MS, aged 45 to 90 years, were used for the study. A multinomial regression model was used to determine factors associated with use of physical therapy services (never, within the past year, more than a year ago). Logistic regression analysis examined factors associated with unmet needs for these services. Results Thirty-six percent of the sample reported never using physical therapy services, 33% reported using physical therapy services within the past year, and 31% reported using physical therapy services more than a year prior to the interview. Factors associated with recent use of physical therapy services included living in an urban or suburban community, deteriorating MS status, experiencing problems with spasticity (ie, hypertonicity), having difficulty moving inside the house, being hospitalized in the past 6 months, and seeing a family physician. These same factors were associated with unmet needs. Limitations Physical therapy service use was self-reported. Data were collected in 5 Midwestern states from people 45 years of age or older, which may limit generalizability. Conclusions Factors associated with use of and need for physical therapy services reflect issues of access (geographical, referrals), MS status, and mobility difficulties.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[0.9999990463256836, 0.0974808856844902, 0.000353562762029469, 0.0024937144480645657, 3.496323017770919e-07, 3.509566113280016e-06, 0.9999896287918091, 4.4509397412184626e-07, 0.9999382495880127]"
229,"cost utility analysis of a medication review with follow up service for older adults with polypharmacy in community pharmacies in spain the consigue program The concept of pharmaceutical care is operationalized through pharmaceutical professional services, which are patient-oriented to optimize their pharmacotherapy and to improve clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a medication review with follow-up (MRF) service for older adults with polypharmacy in Spanish community pharmacies against the alternative of having their medication dispensed normally. The study was designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial, and was carried out over a time horizon of 6 months. The target population was older adults with polypharmacy, defined as individuals taking five or more medicines per day. The study was conducted in 178 community pharmacies in Spain. Cost-utility analysis adopted a health service perspective. Costs were in euros at 2014 prices and the effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). In order to analyze the uncertainty of ICER results, we performed a non-parametric bootstrapping with 5000 replications. A total of 1403 older adults, aged between 65 and 94 years, were enrolled in the study: 688 in the intervention group (IG) and 715 in the control group (CG). By the end of the follow-up, both groups had reduced the mean number of prescribed medications they took, although this reduction was greater in the IG (0.28 ± 1.25 drugs; p < 0.001) than in the CG (0.07 ± 0.95 drugs; p = 0.063). Older adults in the IG saw their quality of life improved by 0.0528 ± 0.20 (p < 0.001). In contrast, the CG experienced a slight reduction in their quality of life: 0.0022 ± 0.24 (p = 0.815). The mean total cost was €977.57 ± 1455.88 for the IG and €1173.44 ± 3671.65 for the CG. In order to estimate the ICER, we used the costs adjusted for baseline medications and QALYs adjusted for baseline utility score, resulting in a mean incremental total cost of −€250.51 ± 148.61 (95 % CI −541.79 to 40.76) and a mean incremental QALY of 0.0156 ± 0.004 (95 % CI 0.008–0.023). Regarding the results from the cost-utility analysis, the MRF service emerged as the dominant strategy. The MRF service is an effective intervention for optimizing prescribed medication and improving quality of life in older adults with polypharmacy in community pharmacies. The results from the cost-utility analysis suggest that the MRF service is cost effective.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999992847442627, 2.4648343242006376e-06, 2.8609656510525383e-05, 0.9998713731765747, 3.44251446904309e-07, 0.9999967813491821, 0.00024971726816147566, 1.467804054300359e-06, 1.0099201972479932e-06]"
230,"analysis of different communication channels for promoting hygiene behaviour A hygiene intervention study reduced diarrhoeal disease transmission in rural northeast Thailand by promoting hand-washing and dish-washing behaviour. Most of the target audience did not recognize a connection between these behaviours and diarrhoeal disease, and therefore a social marketing approach was used to develop a campaign promoting behaviours through a variety of communication channels keeping messages simple and in terms understood by the community. Overall, there was a strong correlation between the number of communication channels remembered by respondents and their knowledge score, with passive channels of printed media such as stickers, posters and leaflets associated with significantly higher scores than other channels. However, the same did not hold true for improvement in actual behaviour and only school children were associated with significantly less fingertip contamination. In-depth interviews with conformers and non-conformers suggested that although most knew the intervention messages well enough, the importance they attached to them differed markedly. Thus dissemination of message knowledge was not consistent with the process of dissemination of actual practice. Where a strong sense of community spirit existed, friends, relatives and neighbours were more likely to discuss intervention activities with each other.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999994039535522, 0.9999991655349731, 0.23813027143478394, 0.9997777342796326, 0.7424871921539307, 0.9997444748878479, 2.3819970920158084e-06, 5.824761046824278e-07, 1.1948446854148642e-06]"
231,"guiding healthier food choice systematic comparison of four front of pack labelling systems and their effect on judgements of product healthiness Different front-of-pack (FOP) labelling systems have been developed in Europe by industry and organisations concerned with health promotion. A study (n 2068) was performed to establish the extent to which inclusion of the most prevalent FOP systems--guideline daily amounts (GDA), traffic lights (TL), GDA+TL hybrid (HYB) and health logos (HL)--impact consumer perceptions of healthiness over and above the provision of a FOP basic label (BL) containing numerical nutritional information alone. The design included within- and between-subjects factors. The within-subjects factors were: food (pizzas, yogurts and biscuits), healthiness of the food (high health, medium health and low health) and the repeated measurements under BL and test FOP label conditions. The between-subjects factors were: the system (GDA, TL, GDA+TL hybrid, HL), portion size (typical portion size and a 50% reduction of a typical portion) and country (the UK, Germany, Poland and Turkey). Although the FOP systems tested did result in small improvements for objective understanding under some conditions, there was little difference between the provision of an FOP label containing basic numerical nutritional information alone or between the various systems. Thus, any structured and legible presentation of key nutrient and energy information on the FOP label is sufficient to enable consumers to detect a healthier alternative within a food category when provided with foods that have distinctly different levels of healthiness. Future research should focus on developing greater understanding of the psychological and contextual factors that impact motivation and the opportunity to use the various FOP systems in real-world shopping settings.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]","[0.9999984502792358, 2.6945003810396884e-06, 0.0007698918343521655, 0.9999823570251465, 3.4380786928522866e-07, 0.9999954700469971, 0.9999023675918579, 0.5394487380981445, 5.960873181720672e-07]"

The relative dearth of policies governing data-sharing practices needs to be addressed and a framework of support developed that incentivizes data-sharing practices for researchers that are both ethical and effective.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.8209467498309095e-06, 1.0945572057607933e-06, 1.1920598808501381e-05, 1.2125721696065739e-05, 3.513349327022297e-07, 3.1710769690107554e-06, 1.0585183645162033e-06, 6.785970754208392e-07, 1.4531406122841872e-06]"
233,"benefits arising from lay involvement in community based public health initiatives the experience from community nutrition Aims: To explore the experiences of lay food and health workers (LFHW) and professionals involved in delivering local food and health initiatives, to improve understanding of the perceived benefits associated with their involvement and wider opportunities for promoting health. Study design: An interpretive qualitative inquiry. Setting: Community-based NHS LFHW programmes in 16 locations serving less-affluent neighbourhoods across England, UK. Subjects: Twenty nine (29) food and health professionals, 53 LFHW employed by and associated with the management or day-to-day implementation of 16 LFHW initiatives in the study. Findings: Salient benefits identified at service, individual lay worker and community levels were: increased service coverage and ability to reach the ‘hard to reach’; personal development; and enhanced social support.

234,"post surgical physical activity enhancing program for elderly patients after hip fracture a randomized controlled trial Background: Hip fracture seriously influences an elderly person’s life and mobility, independent living, and causes earlier mortality. Although surgery is generally successful, many of the elderly suffer from decreased physical ability after surgery for hip fracture. Objectives: To determine the effects of a physical activity enhancing program (PEP) on the level of physical activity of elderly patients after surgical treatment of hip fracture. Methods: A randomized controlled trial of 46 elderly patients was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January 2012 to February 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of the Resnick self-efficacy model (2009) compared with standard care in improving physical activity. The participants were enrolled on a criteria basis and were block randomized into two groups. The intervention group attended four phases of physical training and efficacy based intervention comprising assessment, preparation, practicing, and evaluation phases with face-to-face contact and five telephone calls during seven weeks post-surgery. Results: Six weeks after discharge, the physical activity of the intervention group increased by significantly more than the control group (F 1,43 = 9.63, P < 0.01), with an effect size of 0.18 after controlling for preoperative physical activity. The ratio of the effect on physical activity induced by the PEP was higher than that induced by usual care (65.2% vs. 47.8%). Conclusion: PEP is effective at improving physical activity.

235,"comparison of the effect of two systems for the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding Summary Background Promotion of breastfeeding is an important child-survival intervention, yet little is known about which promotional strategies are the most effective. We aimed to compare the effects on rates of breastfeeding of two systems for promotion of breastfeeding in Brazil—a hospital-based system and the same system combined with a programme of home visits. Methods In February, 2001, maternity staff from two hospitals in Pernambuco, Brazil, were trained according to the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). In a randomised trial between March and August, 2001, 350 mothers giving birth at these hospitals were assigned ten postnatal home visits to promote and support breastfeeding (n=175) or no home visits (n=175). Breastfeeding practices were studied on days 1, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 by researchers unaware of group allocation. The primary outcome measure was the rate of exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 6 months. Analyses were by intention to treat. Findings The hospital-training intervention achieved a high rate (70%) of exclusive breastfeeding in the hospitals, but this rate was not sustained at home and at 10 days of age only 30% of infants were exclusively breastfed The patterns of exclusive breastfeeding in the two trial groups for days 10–180 differed significantly (p Interpretation The BFHI achieves high rates of exclusive breastfeeding in hospital; however, in Brazil at least, the rates fall rapidly thereafter. Reliance on the BFHI as a strategy for breastfeeding promotion should be reassessed. A combination of promotional systems (hospital-based and in the community) is needed.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999985694885254, 1.5146409850785858e-06, 3.1366595067083836e-05, 1.0906843272096012e-05, 3.472592879916192e-07, 0.999948263168335, 0.9983540773391724, 8.92182697498356e-07, 9.294649885305262e-07]"
236,"parenting and early development among children of drug abusing women effects of home intervention Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of home intervention with drug-abusing women on parenting behavior and attitudes, and on children9s development. Design. A randomized, clinical trial of 60 drug-abusing women recruited prenatally and randomized into an intervention (n = 31) or comparison (n = 29) group. There were no group differences in gestational age, 1-minute Apgar scores, duration of hospital stay, or neonatal abstinence score. Intervention infants were slightly heavier (P = .098) and had slightly lower 5-minute Apgar scores (P = .089). Most mothers were single, African-American, multiparous, and non-high school graduates from low income families. Approximately 40% of the women were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, all admitted to either cocaine and/or heroin use, and 62% had a history of incarceration. Intervention and comparison group women did not differ on any background variables. Interventions. All children received primary care in a multidisciplinary clinic. Biweekly home visits were provided by a nurse beginning before delivery and extending through 18 months of life. The intervention was designed to provide maternal support and to promote parenting, child development, the utilization of informal and formal resources, and advocacy. Measurements. Behavioral measures included self-reported ongoing drug abuse, compliance with primary care appointments, and an observation of the child-centered quality of the home (HOME Scale). Parenting attitudes were measured by the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) and the Parenting Stress Index. The CAPI was administered before initiating the intervention and the Parenting Stress Index was administered when the children were 3 months of age. Both scales were repeated when the children were 18 months of age. Developmental status was measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development administered at 6, 12, and 18 months. Analyses. Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance were used to examine changes in parenting attitudes and children9s development. Analyses of covariance were used to examine compliance with primary care appointments and the quality of the home. Logistic regression was used to examine ongoing drug abuse. Birth weight and maternal education were used as covariates in all analyses. To control for social desirability, the faking-good index of the CAPI was included as a covariate in analyses involving self-report measures. Main results. Women in the intervention group were marginally more likely to report being drug-free (P = .059) and were compliant with primary care appointments for their children (P = .069). Based on the HOME Scale, women in the intervention group were more emotionally responsive (P = .033) and provided marginally more opportunities for stimulation (P = .065). At 18 months parents reported more normative attitudes regarding parenting and more child-related stress than they had initially, but the differences were not related to intervention status. At 6 months infants in the intervention group obtained marginally higher cognitive scores (P = .099); at 12 and 18 months there were no differences. Conclusions. The findings suggest a cautious optimism regarding the efficacy of early home intervention among drug-abusing women in promoting positive behaviors. Subsequent investigations of home intervention should include larger sample sizes and more intensive options.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]","[0.05501066893339157, 0.9999982118606567, 5.757451435783878e-05, 0.9998086094856262, 3.384175784049148e-07, 0.999997615814209, 0.9999990463256836, 6.123333946561615e-07, 0.999974250793457]"

238,"evaluation of a community based intervention to increase breastfeeding prevalence Background The aim of the study was to determine whether peer counselling in the antenatal and post-natal period would increase the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding among low-income women in Glasgow. Methods The study was designed as a quasi-experimental evaluation of a community-based breastfeeding promotion programme. The intervention comprised peer counselling of pregnant women, support of breastfeeding mothers and local awareness-raising activities. The study subjects were all women attending the antenatal booking clinic resident in either the intervention or control area. Data were collected by means of four self-completion questionnaires, two administered antenatally and two post-natally. The proportions intending to breastfeed or breastfeeding in the intervention and control groups were compared at each assessment and over time. Results Of the 995 women enrolled in the study, data were available for analysis on 919 (92 per cent) to 6 weeks postnatally. At booking, 18 per cent of the intervention group and 21 per cent of the control group stated an intention to breastfeed. At delivery, the proportions initiating breastfeeding were 23 per cent of the intervention subjects and 20 per cent of the controls, and by 6 weeks post-natally, the proportion providing any breast milk had declined to 10 per cent of the intervention group and 8 per cent of the control group. Using multivariate analysis to adjust for factors (such as socio-economic status) known to influence breastfeeding, the breastfeeding prevalence was significantly higher in the intervention group relative to the controls at delivery [odds ratio (OR) 2.0; 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 1.2‐3.1, p = 0.006]. By 6 weeks post-natally the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (OR 1.8; 95 per cent CI 1.0‐3.4, p = 0.07). Conclusions As the impact of the intervention was not sustained even for the modest duration of 6 weeks postnatally, it would be premature to justify widespread use of peer support programmes to increase the prevalence of breastfeeding in socially disadvantaged communities.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.00010585891868686303, 0.003998130094259977, 8.747238098294474e-06, 6.753871275577694e-06, 3.273742663623125e-07, 6.73163594910875e-05, 0.9999991655349731, 7.793371423758799e-07, 2.5075156372622587e-05]"

240,"postpartum depression women s help seeking behaviour and perceptions of cause Research on postnatal depression has largely concentrated on investigating its possible causes. There have been few attempts to examine women s own perceptions and experiences of the condition or to explore the implications which these might have for help seeking and professional intervention. This paper reports on the experiences of depression of a sample of 60 first-time mothers. For the purposes of the study, depression was defined as the experience of depressed mood for a period of at least 2 weeks at some stage during the first 9 months postpartum. On this definition, depression was reported by a high proportion of the mothers (63%) and was found to be of early onset and lengthy duration. The majority of depressed mothers did not seek help from any source and only a quarter of them consulted a health professional. These low rates of consultation are explained in terms of mothers perceptions of the cause of their depression, their ideas about appropriate solutions and their reluctance to admit to experiencing emotional difficulties. The implications of the study for intervention by health professionals are discussed.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.9999934434890747, 0.16582024097442627, 1.4569464838132262e-05, 0.9999921321868896, 4.364180483662494e-07, 7.91931597632356e-06, 0.4707440137863159, 4.979214054401382e-07, 0.9999637603759766]"

Low-income African-American children watch greater amounts of television than their peers. Design Methods: A randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial was conducted. Twenty-eight families with 7- to 12-year-old African-American children receiving primary care at an urban community clinic serving a low-income population were randomized to receive counseling alone or counseling plus a behavioral intervention that included an electronic television time manager. The main outcome was hours of children s television, videotape, and video game use. Parents/guardians and children completed baseline and 4-week follow-up self-report surveys. Additional outcomes included overall household television use, time spent in organized physical activity and playing outside, and meals eaten by the child while watching television.

245,"randomized controlled trial of universal postnatal nurse home visiting impact on emergency care BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although nurse home visiting has proven efficacious with small samples, scaling up to community populations with diverse families has not yet proven effective. The Durham Connects program was developed in collaboration with community leaders as a brief, universal, postnatal nurse home visiting intervention designed to screen for risk, provide brief intervention, and connect families with more intensive evidence-based services as needed. This study tested program effectiveness in reducing infant emergency medical care between birth and age 12 months. METHODS: All 4777 resident births in Durham, North Carolina across 18 months were randomly assigned, with even birth date families to intervention and odd birth date families to control. Intervention families were offered 3 to 7 contacts between 3 and 12 weeks after birth to assess family needs and connect parents with community resources to improve infant health and well-being. Hospital records were analyzed by using an intent-to-treat design to evaluate impact among a representative subset of 549 families. RESULTS: After demographic factors (ie, birth risk, Medicaid status, ethnicity, and single parenthood) were covaried, relative to control families, families assigned to intervention had 50% less total emergency medical care use (mean [M] emergency department visits and hospital overnights) (Mintervention = 0.78 and Mcontrol = 1.57; P < .001, effect size = 0.28) across the first 12 months of life. CONCLUSIONS: This brief, universal, postnatal nurse home visiting program improves population-level infant health care outcomes for the first 12 months of life. Nurse home visiting can be implemented universally at high fidelity with positive impacts on infant emergency health care that are similar to those of longer, more intensive home visiting programs. This approach offers a novel solution to the paradox of targeting by offering individually tailored intervention while achieving population-level impact. * Abbreviations: DC — : Durham Connects ED — : emergency department M — : mean RCT — : randomized controlled trial","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[5.384529686125461e-06, 7.460094820999075e-06, 1.9729157429537736e-05, 6.324150945147267e-06, 3.4277789495718025e-07, 0.27015379071235657, 0.9999988079071045, 1.045826024892449e-06, 0.9967336654663086]"
246,"visible and invisible ageing beauty work as a response to ageism This paper examines how older women experience and respond to ageism in relation to their changing physical appearances and within the context of their personal relationships and places of employment. We elucidate the two definitions of ageism that emerged in in-depth interviews with 44 women aged 50 to 70 years: the social obsession with youthfulness and discrimination against older adults. We examine the women s arguments that their ageing appearances were pivotal to their experience of ageism and underscored their engagement in beauty work such as hair dye, make-up, cosmetic surgery, and non-surgical cosmetic procedures. The women suggested that they engaged in beauty work for the following underlying motivations: the fight against invisibility, a life-long investment in appearance, the desire to attract or retain a romantic partner, and employment related-ageism. We contend that the women s experiences highlight a tension between being physically and socially visible by virtue of looking youthful, and the realities of growing older. In other words, social invisibility arises from the acquisition of visible signs of ageing and compels women to make their chronological ages imperceptible through the use of beauty work. The study extends the research and theorising on gendered ageism and provides an example of how women s experiences of ageing and ageism are deeply rooted in their appearances and in the ageist, sexist perceptions of older women s bodies.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[5.258737587610085e-07, 1.5994204659364186e-05, 5.814602627651766e-05, 0.9999891519546509, 3.935856227599288e-07, 5.392544699134305e-05, 9.271075214201119e-07, 6.36468541870272e-07, 0.996742308139801]"
247,"impact of micronutrient fortification of yoghurt on micronutrient status markers and growth a randomized double blind controlled trial among school children in bangladesh Interventions providing foods fortified with multiple micronutrients can be a cost-effective and sustainable strategy to improve micronutrient status and physical growth of school children. We evaluated the effect of micronutrient-fortified yoghurt on the biochemical status of important micronutrients (iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin A) as well as growth indicators among school children in Bogra district of Bangladesh. In a double-masked randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 4 primary schools, 1010 children from classes 1–4 (age 6–9 years) were randomly allocated to receive either micronutrient fortified yoghurt (FY, n = 501) or non-fortified yoghurt (NFY, n = 509). For one year, children were fed with 60 g yoghurt everyday providing 30% RDA for iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A. Anthropometric measurements and blood/urine samples were collected at base-, mid- and end-line. All children (FY, n = 278, NFY, n = 293) consenting for the end-line blood sample were included in the present analyses. Both groups were comparable at baseline for socio-economic status variables, micronutrient status markers and anthropometry measures. Compliance was similar in both the groups. At baseline 53.4% of the population was anemic; 2.1% was iron deficient (ferritin 8.3 mg/L). Children in the FY group showed improvement in Hb (mean difference: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.4-2.5; p = 0.006) as compared to NFY group. Retinol binding protein (mean diff: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.002-0.09; p = 0.04) and iodine levels (mean difference: 39.87; 95% CI: 20.39-59.35; p < 0.001) decreased between base and end-line but the decrease was significantly less in the FY group. Compared to NFY, the FY group had better height gain velocity (mean diff: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.05-0.60; p = 0.02) and height-for-age z-scores (mean diff: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02-0.33; p = 0.03). There was no difference in weight gain velocity, weight-for-age z-scores or Body Mass Index z-scores. In the absence of iron deficiency at baseline the impact on iron status would not be expected to be observed and hence cannot be evaluated. Improved Hb concentrations in the absence of a change in iron status suggest improved utilization of iron possibly due to vitamin A and zinc availability. Fortification improved height gain without affecting weight gain.

248,"the utility of short message service sms texts to remind patients at higher risk of stis and hiv to reattend for testing a controlled before and after study Background Patients attending for sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV testing may be at continuing risk of infection and advised to return for retesting at a later date. Objectives To measure the impact of short message service (SMS) text reminders on the reattendance rates of patients who require repeat STI testing. Methods Reattendance rates were measured for two groups of higher risk patients: those listed for routine SMS text reminders in 2012 and a control group of patients from 2011 with the same risk profile who had not received any active recall. Reattendance was counted if it was within 4 months of the end of the episode of care. Results Reattendance rates were not statistically different between the text group 32% (89/274) and the control group 35% (92/266). Reattendance also was not statistically different between the text and control groups respectively in patients with the following risks: recent chlamydia 43/121 (36%) versus 41/123 (33%), recent gonorrhoea 4/21 (19%) versus 7/21 (33%), recent emergency contraception 27/60 (45%) versus 25/56 (45%) and other risks 7/27 (26%) versus 9/26 (35%). High rates of STIs were found in patients who reattended in both the text group (13/90, 14%) and control group (15/91, 17%) and at even higher rates at reattendance if the reason for recall was chlamydia infection at the initial visit: 9/43 (21%) in the text group and 10/41 (24%) in the control group. Conclusions SMS texts sent as reminders to patients at higher risk of STIs and HIV did not increase the reattendance rate, when compared with standard advice, in this service which already has a high reattendance rate. STI rates were high in those patients who reattended.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[1.5016463521533296e-06, 1.2576915651152376e-06, 1.4168901543598622e-05, 0.9997287392616272, 3.690138044021296e-07, 4.295182407076936e-06, 7.611531600559829e-07, 1.5130716519706766e-06, 0.9999972581863403]"
249,"harnessing expertise involving peer interviewers in qualitative research with hard to reach populations The use of peer interviewers with privileged access to a particular population group, which is difficult to reach via more conventional methods, has been acknowledged in recent research. This paper explores a number of key issues relating to the employment of peer interviewers by reflecting on a project designed to explore the views and experiences of parents who use illegal drugs. The project presented the research team with a number of challenges. These included the need to provide on-going support for the interviewers, a sense of distance felt by the researchers from the raw data they collected, and the difficulties of gaining from the skills and experiences of peer interviewers without exploiting their labour. The paper also explores the advantages of involving peer interviewers closely in research work and reflects on the nature and boundaries of expert knowledge that can become evident in such collaborations. The need for a certain amount of flexibility over the roles and domains of control that lay experts and researchers traditionally inhabit is suggested. In conclusion, it is argued that the involvement of peer interviewers in research can be a valuable means of enhancing our knowledge and understanding of a variety of population groups who tend to live beyond the gaze of more orthodox researchers.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.021316668018698692, 0.2070007473230362, 3.826456668321043e-05, 7.104469659680035e-06, 4.0371853060605645e-07, 2.1099183413753053e-06, 4.386580712889554e-06, 6.674090968772362e-07, 0.0008984297746792436]"

Design Potential predictors of fruit intake were assessed at baseline, and fruit intake was assessed at two-week follow-up with self-administered questionnaires distributed by e-mail. Setting The study was conducted among Dutch adult members of an Internet research panel Participants A random sample of 627 adults aged 18-78. Variables Measured Attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, expected pros and cons, habit strength, intention, and fruit intake. Fruit intake was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Analysis Hierarchical linear and logistic regression analyses. Alpha Results Sex, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived pros, different self-efficacy expectations, and habit strength were significantly associated with the intention to eat two or more servings of fruit per day. Age, intentions, and habit strength were significant predictors of consumption of two or more servings of fruit per day. Conclusions and Implications The results confirm that Theory of Planned Behavior constructs predict fruit intake, and that habit strength and different self-efficacy expectations may be additional determinants relevant to fruit intake. Because habitual behavior is considered to be triggered by environmental cues, fruit promotion interventions should further explore environmental change strategies.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999994039535522, 0.16414938867092133, 2.1899561033933423e-05, 7.011884918028954e-06, 3.909948986802192e-07, 0.9999831914901733, 8.617053026682697e-07, 1.028299038807745e-06, 7.522870077991684e-07]"

The effects of treatment counseling or symptom monitoring telephone intervention strategies on the health outcomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA), compared with usual care, were assessed. Methods. A 3-group, randomized, controlled 9-month trial was conducted incorporating 405 patients with RA or OA and using the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS2) as the outcome measure. Results. Analyses of covariance showed that the AIMS2 total health status of the treatment counseling group (effect size = 33, P < 0.01), but not the symptom monitoring group (effect size = 0.21, P = 0.10), was significantly improved, compared with usual care, for both RA and OA patients. The specific types of benefits differed significantly between RA and OA patients. The mean number of medical visits by OA patients in the treatment counseling group was also significantly reduced (P < 0.01). Conclusion. Telephone contact using the treatment counseling strategy produced significant, but different, health status benefits for RA and OA patients. The symptom monitoring strategy produced modest benefits.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]","[0.9999943971633911, 0.9994693398475647, 0.9980487823486328, 0.9999350309371948, 3.7704202782151697e-07, 0.9921869039535522, 1.7456331988796592e-06, 0.9723845720291138, 2.632338691910263e-06]"

254,"e cigarette awareness use and harm perceptions in italy a national representative survey Introduction Only a few studies have provided information on awareness, use, and harm perceptions of e-cigarettes in Europe. We fill the knowledge gap in Italy. Methods We used data from a face-to-face survey conducted in 2013 of a sample of 3,000 individuals, representative of the Italian population aged ≥15 years (51.1 million inhabitants). Results Awareness of e-cigarettes was 91.1%; it was lowest among women (87.8%), the elderly (78.4%), those with less education (84.1%), and never-smokers (89.0%). Ever e-cigarette use was 6.8% overall and was inversely related to age, whereas no significant difference was observed according to sex. With regard to smoking status, 2.6% of never-smokers, 7.0% of ex-smokers, and 20.4% of current smokers tried the e-cigarette at least once. Regular e-cigarette use was 1.2% overall, 1.5% among men, and 0.9% among women, and it was highest among young (2.4%) and current smokers (3.7%). Among 36 e-cigarette regular users, 22.0% did not change their smoking habit, 67.7% reduced traditional cigarette consumption, and 10.4% quit smoking. Conclusions After fewer than 3 years from the opening of the first Italian e-cigarette shop, more than 45 million Italians have heard about e-cigarettes, 3.5 million have tried e-cigaretts, and more than 600,000 Italians regularly use e-cigarettes. Three out of 4 e-cigarette users reported to have favorably modified their smoking habit; however, 90% of users did not quit smoking as a consequence of starting vaping e-cigarettes.

255,"the utility of volunteer home visiting support to prevent maternal depression in the first year of life Background Maternal depression can be detrimental to infant development. Structured home visiting initiated either in pregnancy or soon after the birth by a professional has led to better outcomes for mothers and their children but some vulnerable families may respond more favourably to a local volunteer. The value of volunteer support provided in the UK by Home-Start for maternal well-being is noted in qualitative studies, but there is no evidence of its impact from trials. The support is not structured and both the frequency and content of visits may vary. Methods A cluster randomized study allocated Home-Start local schemes to intervention or control conditions. Mothers in all areas were screened at routine health checks in late pregnancy. In intervention areas names of those scoring 9+ on the Social Disadvantage Screening Index were passed to Home-Start to be offered a volunteer. Not all those offered the support accepted the offer. In control areas no support was offered. Research assessments were conducted at 2 and 12 months. The outcomes were major or minor depression occurring between 2 and 12 months (Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual – Third Edition – Revised) and depression symptoms at 12 months (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). Three groups were compared: supported, case-matched controls and those offered but not receiving support. Results Almost one-third experienced depression during the time period. Volunteer support had no identifiable impact on the emergence of maternal depression from 2 to 12 months or on depression symptoms when infants were 12 months.

We tested two hypotheses concerning the behavioural impact of informing smokers their oral dose of NRT is tailored to analysis of DNA. Methods and Findings We conducted an RCT with smokers in smoking cessation clinics (N = 633). In combination with NRT patch, participants were informed that their doses of oral NRT were based either on their mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) genotype, or their nicotine dependence questionnaire score (phenotype). The proportion of prescribed NRT consumed in the first 28 days following quitting was not significantly different between groups: (68.5% of prescribed NRT consumed in genotype vs 63.6%, phenotype group, difference = 5.0%, 95% CI −0.9,10.8, p = 0.098). Motivation to make another quit attempt among those (n = 331) not abstinent at six months was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.23). Abstinence at 28 days was not different between groups (p = 0.67); at six months was greater in genotype than phenotype group (13.7% vs 7.9%, difference = 5.8%, 95% CI 1.0,10.7, p = 0.018). Conclusions Informing smokers their oral dose of NRT was tailored to genotype not phenotype had a small, statistically non-significant effect on 28-day adherence to NRT. Among those still smoking at six months, there was no evidence that saying NRT was tailored to genotype adversely affected motivation to make another quit attempt.

259,"an investigation into the relevance of action planning theory of planned behaviour concepts and automaticity for fruit intake action control Objectives In the action control framework, intention-behaviour discordance is studied around public health guidelines. Although this framework has been applied to physical activity behaviours, it has only seen very limited attention regarding fruit intake. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate distributions and predictors of fruit intake intention-behaviour discordance. Design Prospective correlational design. Methods Data were obtained from undergraduate students (n = 413) using validated questionnaires. Variables from the theory of planned behaviour, automaticity, and action planning were assessed at baseline, and fruit intake was assessed 2 weeks later. Data were analysed using discriminant function analyses and analyses of variance. Results The proportion of unsuccessful intenders ranged from 39.2% to 80.8%. There was a larger proportion of fruit intake intenders amongst those who reported strong automatic fruit intake. Action control was predicted by fruit intake automaticity and affective attitudes, but the strongest predictor was perceived behavioural control. No action planning items were related to fruit intake action control. Conclusions There is considerable asymmetry in the intention-fruit intake relationship. An application of the action control framework may stimulate debate on the applicability of intention-based models at the public health level. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Intention is theorized to be a key construct in fruit intake. Studies in the physical activity domain indicate that nearly half of the people with positive intentions fail to subsequently act. What does this study add? The proportion of unsuccessful intenders ranged from 39.2% to 80.8%. Holding positive intentions is not sufficient to consume fruit at suggested public health guidelines. Perceived behavioural control is the most important predictor of fruit intake action control.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999991655349731, 1.6987570461424184e-06, 2.0503288396866992e-05, 7.355484285653802e-06, 3.642023500560754e-07, 0.999997615814209, 3.277126234024763e-05, 6.03842977398017e-07, 5.782260359410429e-07]"
260,"multi micronutrient fortified biscuits decreased prevalence of anemia and improved micronutrient status and effectiveness of deworming in rural vietnamese school children Concurrent micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent among Vietnamese school children. A school-based program providing food fortified with multiple micronutrients could be a cost-effective and sustainable strategy to improve health and cognitive function of school children. However, the efficacy of such an intervention may be compromised by the high prevalence of parasitic infestation. To evaluate the efficacy of school-based intervention using multi-micronutrient-fortified biscuits with or without deworming on anemia and micronutrient status in Vietnamese schoolchildren, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 510 primary schoolchildren, aged 6-8 y, in rural Vietnam. Albendazole (Alb) (400 mg) or placebo was given at baseline. Nonfortified or multi-micronutrient-fortified biscuits including iron (6 mg), zinc (5.6 mg), iodine (35 microg), and vitamin A (300 microg retinol equivalents) were given 5 d/wk for 4 mo. Multi-micronutrient fortification significantly improved the concentrations of hemoglobin (+1.87 g/L; 95% CI: 0.78, 2.96), plasma ferritin (+7.5 microg/L; 95% CI: 2.8, 12.6), body iron (+0.56 mg/kg body weight; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.84), plasma zinc (+0.61 micromol/L; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.95), plasma retinol (+0.041 micromol/L; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.08), and urinary iodine (+22.49 micromol/L; 95% CI: 7.68, 37.31). Fortification reduced the risk of anemia and deficiencies of zinc and iodine by >40%. Parasitic infestation did not affect fortification efficacy, whereas fortification significantly enhanced deworming efficacy, with the lowest reinfection rates in children receiving both micronutrients and Alb. Multi-micronutrient fortification of biscuits is an effective strategy to improve the micronutrient status of Vietnamese schoolchildren and enhances effectiveness of deworming.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 9.929553016263526e-06, 0.9970255494117737, 0.9999834299087524, 1.4036852462595562e-06, 9.21453392948024e-05, 0.0031520624179393053, 2.6938992050418165e-06, 5.906650244469347e-07]"

This study examined the application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to two dietary behaviours with a particular focus on the roles of perceived control and self-efficacy as two components of the perceived behavioural control construct in the TPB. Methods. A total of 287 members of the general public completed questionnaires, one concerning the influence of TPB variables on intentions and behaviour for either eating five portions of fruit and vegetables per day (N = 144) or eating a low-fat diet (N= 143), and the second concerning actual eating behaviour one month later. In addition, the individual components of perceived behavioural control (perceived control and self-efficacy) and their determinant beliefs were examined. Results. For each behaviour, the TPB variables were found to be good predictors of intentions (fat intake, R 2 = .637; fruit and vegetable intake, R 2 = .572), although less good at predicting behaviour (fat intake, R 2 = .185; fruit and vegetable intake, R 2 = .321), with self-efficacy being consistently more predictive than perceived control.

262,"eating behaviors of older african americans an application of the theory of planned behavior Purpose: The study applies the theory of planned behavior to explain the fruit and vegetable eating behaviors, a broad construct consisting of preparing, self-monitoring, and consuming fruits and vegetables, of older African Americans. Design and Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to examine the applicability of the theory of planned behavior with data from 211 older African American women and men (73% women, 26% men; median age range of 57–63 years) participating in a larger intervention study. Results: Attitudes about eating fruit and vegetables, subjective social norms, and perceived behavioral control were related to older African Americans’ intentions to consume fruits and vegetables. Social norms and behavioral intentions were associated with fruit and vegetable eating behaviors. Perceived control did not moderate the influence of behavioral intentions on actual behavior. Implications: Results indicated that the theory of planned behavior can be used to explain variation in older African Americans’ eating behavior. This study also emphasizes the value of considering broader behavioral domains when employing the theory of planned behavior rather than focusing on specific behaviors. Furthermore, social service programs aimed at reducing the incidence of diseases commonly associated with poor eating behaviors among older African Americans must consider promoting not only fruit and vegetable consumption but also related behaviors including preparing and self-monitoring by eliminating structural, cognitive, and normative constraints.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999849796295166, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9899181723594666, 5.575886916631134e-06, 3.5628070804705203e-07, 0.9999974966049194, 6.113301787991077e-05, 1.130584337261098e-06, 6.449876650549413e-07]"

Effects of resistance training on lower-extremity impairments in older people with hip fracture. Objective To study the effects of resistance training on muscle strength parameters, mobility, and balance. Design Randomized controlled trial. Setting Research laboratory and senior gym. Participants Population-based sample of eligible 60- to 85-year-old community-dwelling men and women 0.5 to 7.0 years after hip fracture. Forty-six people had no contraindications and were willing to participate in the exercise trial. Intervention Twelve-week intensive progressive strength-power training (n=24), aiming to reduce asymmetric deficit in leg muscle strength and power, or no intervention (n=22). Main Outcome Measures Isometric knee extension torque (KET) and leg extension power (LEP) measured in the weaker and stronger leg and the asymmetric deficit ([weak/sum both legs]×100%), 10-m walking speed, dynamic balance test, and self-reported outdoor mobility. Results KET increased in both legs ( P P =.071), and asymmetric LEP deficit decreased ( P =.010) after training compared with the control group. LEP of the stronger leg, asymmetric KET deficit, walking speed, and balance performance were not significantly affected by training. Self-reported ability to walk outdoors improved after training. The compliance to the training was over 90%, and few adverse events (n=4; mainly musculoskeletal) were likely to be caused by the training. Conclusions Intensive resistance training is feasible for people with a hip fracture and improved muscle strength and power. More intensive training especially for the weaker leg may be needed to obtain more marked effects on asymmetric deficit, mobility, and balance. Also, the timing and duration of training program should be considered.

Studies were excluded if there was no cross-border movement or comparison group or if the receiving country was not western and industrialised. Studies were assessed for quality, analysed descriptively and meta-analysed when possible. We identified 133 reports (>20,000,000 migrants), only 23 of which could be meta-analysed.

269,"tackling health inequalities and social exclusion through partnership and community engagement a reality check for policy and practice aspirations from a social inclusion partnership in scotland In the contemporary UK policy context, multisectoral partnership initiatives and community participation are increasingly viewed as appropriate mechanisms for tackling health and social disadvantage. Such initiatives are often put into practice in contexts of industrial and economic decline, fragmented neighbourhoods, hard-pressed public services, and sustained under-investment in voluntary and community sector organisations. This paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork in a Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) in Scotland to suggest that policy-makers and public health practitioners need a better understanding of the difficulties involved in implementing partnership and participation initiatives in this kind of context. The East Kirkland SIP was set up to tackle social exclusion and health inequalities within the most deprived neighbourhoods of a Scottish town, yet community engagement remained elusive. Partnership proved to be risky territory for all involved, marked by rivalry and suspicion between SIP members, rather than co-operation, whilst health promotion and social inclusion priorities conflicted with those of community development and regeneration.

270,"how u s adults find out about electronic cigarettes implications for public health messages INTRODUCTION Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-powered nicotine delivery systems that have become increasingly popular in the United States. We sought to understand how U.S. adults hear about e-cigarettes. METHODS A national sample of 17,522 U.S. adults (≥ 18 years old) completed an online survey in March 2013 assessing their awareness of and sources of information about e-cigarettes. RESULTS Most respondents (86%) had heard of e-cigarettes. Current and former smokers were more likely to be aware of e-cigarettes than non-smokers. Males, younger adults, non-Hispanic Whites, and those with higher education were also more likely to have heard of e-cigarettes. The most commonly reported sources of information were another person, ads on television, and seeing e-cigarettes being sold, although the relative frequency of these sources differed for current, former, and never-smokers. Former and current smokers were more likely to have heard about e-cigarettes from e-cigarette users than were never-smokers. Adults age 30 years or younger were more likely than adults older than 30 years to have heard about e-cigarettes online. CONCLUSIONS Nearly all U.S. adults had heard of e-cigarettes in 2013. By focusing on the most common channels of information, public health campaigns can more efficiently communicate information about e-cigarette safety and consider necessary regulations should companies use these channels for marketing that targets youth, non-tobacco users, and other at-risk groups.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[7.31183206426067e-07, 0.9997835755348206, 8.205002814065665e-06, 0.9999849796295166, 3.745898027318617e-07, 3.191508585587144e-05, 0.9999984502792358, 1.004995169751055e-06, 4.999598104404868e-07]"

We studied the National Cancer Data Base, a joint endeavor of the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society, to identify disparities in 30-day mortality after lung cancer resection based on these nonclinical factors. Study Design We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients undergoing lung cancer resection from 2003 to 2011 using the National Cancer Data Base. Data were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for 30-day mortality. Results During our study period, 215,645 patients underwent lung cancer resection. We found that clinical variables, such as age, sex, comorbidity, cancer stage, preoperative radiation, extent of resection, positive surgical margins, and tumor size were associated with 30-day mortality after resection. Nonclinical factors, including living in lower-income neighborhoods with a lesser proportion of high school graduates, and receiving cancer care at a nonacademic medical center were also independently associated with increased 30-day postoperative mortality. Conclusions This study represents the largest analysis of 30-day mortality for lung cancer resection to date from a generalizable national cohort. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to known clinical risk factors, several nonclinical factors are associated with increased 30-day mortality after lung cancer resection. These disparities require additional investigation to improve lung cancer patient outcomes.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[7.912951218713715e-07, 8.071953061516979e-07, 0.00011130144412163645, 4.4707180677505676e-06, 3.5457978242448007e-07, 0.9999935626983643, 0.9999991655349731, 6.899286404404847e-07, 5.716857458537561e-07]"
272,"making decisions gender and sport participation among british adolescents This study explored the dynamics of how young people make decisions about their sport participation. In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 34 young men and 26 young women, ages 13-23 (only 3 were older than 18), from predominantly working-class families residing in an industrial area southeast of London. Interviews focused on descriptions of sport experiences, how young people defined and interpreted those experiences, how this influenced decisions about participation, and how participation was integrated into the rest of their lives. We found that young women and men shared concerns about their transition into adulthood and had common desires to develop and display personal competence and autonomy. However, these common concerns were significantly mediated by gender. Furthermore, gender differences were found in the ways sport experiences were defined and interpreted, in the ways that constraints related to money, parents, and opposite-sex friends operated, and in the ways that past experiences in physical education and school sports were incorporated into current decision- making about sport participation.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.1956256777048111, 0.1305040419101715, 1.960088593477849e-05, 0.9999934434890747, 4.2374347231088905e-07, 2.3910235995572293e-06, 0.9999986886978149, 9.59874341788236e-07, 4.5898210373707116e-05]"
273,"randomized trial of an intervention to improve mammography utilization among a triracial rural population of women It is estimated that, during 2006, 212 920 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40 970 will die of the disease (1). Techniques for early detection of breast cancer, including mammography and clinical breast examination, have been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality by 30% in women aged 50 and older (2–5), although the benefit of mammography screening among women aged 40–49 is still under debate (5–7). Despite the fact that rates of screening mammography have increased over the last several years, many women do not routinely obtain mammograms, and it is estimated that only 70% of women aged 40 and older had a mammogram within the past 2 years (8). Minority women, older women, women of low socioeconomic status, and those who live in rural areas have low rates of mammography (8, 9). Compared with white women, African American women have lower rates of breast cancer screening examinations (8, 10) and higher rates of breast cancer mortality. Racial differences in rates of screening and mortality are thought to be even more pronounced among rural women because these women are more likely than residents of more urban areas to be poor (9, 11, 12). For example, data from a study conducted in two rural counties in eastern North Carolina indicated that white women aged 50–74 were twice as likely to have had a recent mammogram as African American women of the same age group (54% and 27%, respectively) (9). Native Americans have the poorest rates of survival from cancer of any racial group in the United States (13). Some studies suggest that this racial/ethnic group has higher rates of cancer risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, and poor dietary habits) and lower rates of cancer screening than other groups (14–18). However, few cancer prevention and control studies have been conducted among Native American populations. One strategy that has been shown to improve cancer screening in minority and rural populations is the use of lay health advisors (LHAs), community residents who have been trained to deliver health information. LHAs have been used to improve breast cancer screening in rural, mostly African American women in community settings (19, 20) and to improve breast and cervical cancer screening among mainly minority, urban women in a community trial (21). A recent meta-analysis found a small but positive effect of LHAs in promoting breast cancer screening (22). Although the LHA approach has been shown to be effective for various racial and ethnic groups of women (23–31), no randomized trial, to our knowledge, of LHA interventions for mammography utilization has been conducted among minority, rural women. The goal of the Robeson County Outreach Screening and Education (ROSE) Project (32) is to use LHAs to deliver an individualized health education intervention to improve rates of mammography screening in a population of women who are traditionally underserved by cancer control efforts—specifically, low-income, rural white, African American, and Native American women. The ROSE project includes 897 women aged older than 40 years who had not had a mammogram within the 12 months before enrollment. Each participant completed a survey that asked about her knowledge and behaviors regarding breast and cervical cancer screening. We previously reported that these low-income, rural women, especially Native American and African American women, experienced statistically significantly higher barriers than other women, maintained inaccurate beliefs, and had reduced knowledge regarding cancer screening (32). These same women were randomly assigned to receive an LHA intervention or to a comparison group for 12–14 months following their baseline survey. Here we report the results of this randomized trial in terms of the overall impact of the LHA intervention. Our primary hypothesis was that women who received the LHA intervention would have higher mammography screening rates than the comparison group at follow-up and that the effect would be similar within each racial group. Our secondary hypotheses were that the LHA intervention would result in improved knowledge and beliefs about mammography screening and in reduced barriers to obtaining this screening. Other goals of the study were to compare self-report and medical record–verified screening to assess the need for medical record review in intervention studies of this type and to assess the cost of the intervention for future replication.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999911785125732, 0.9999947547912598, 1.0548337741056457e-05, 4.599692147166934e-06, 3.756544515454152e-07, 2.6566489395918325e-05, 0.9999986886978149, 4.88097043671587e-07, 0.0021290024742484093]"

Time credits are earned for each hour of voluntary service given, and can be used to purchase services from other members in return. This article discusses new findings from the first national study of time banks to assess their impacts and potential. An evaluative framework is employed which describes social inclusion as comprising effective economic, social and political citizenship rights. Evidence is presented from a national survey of time banks and from an in-depth case study of Rushey Green Time Bank, situated in a health care setting in a deprived area of south London. Time banks are found to be successful at engaging socially excluded and vulnerable groups of people in community activities — many for the first time — boosting their confidence, social networks, skills and well-being, as well as opening up possibilities for challenging inequitable social institutions and creating spaces where different values prevail. Their potential as tools for democratic renewal, promoting civic engagement and active citizenship is discussed.

275,"effect of an education programme for patients with osteoarthritis in primary care a randomized controlled trial Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease, considered to be one of the major public health problems. Research suggests that patient education is feasible and valuable for achieving improvements in quality of life, in function, well-being and improved coping. Since 1994, Primary Health Care in Malmo has used a patient education programme directed towards OA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of this education programme for patients with OA in primary health care in terms of self-efficacy, function and self-perceived health. Method: The study was a single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the EuroQol-5D and Arthritis selfefficacy scale were used to measure self-perceived health and self-efficacy and function was measured with Grip Ability Test for the upper extremity and five different functional tests for the lower extremity. Results: We found differences between the intervention group and the control group, comparing the results at baseline and after 6 months in EuroQol-5D (p < 0.001) and in standing one leg eyes closed (p = 0.02) in favour of the intervention group. No other differences between the groups were found. Conclusion: This study has shown that patient education for patients with osteoarthritis is feasible in a primary health care setting and can improve self-perceived health as well as function in some degree, but not self-efficacy. Further research to investigate the effect of exercise performance on function, as well as self-efficacy is warranted. Trial registration: The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.

278,"narrowing the treatment gap with equitable access mid term outcomes of a community case management program in cameroon Coverage of case management interventions remains low and inadequate to achieve millennium development goal (MDG) target reductions in child mortality. Children living in the poorest households are particularly disadvantaged. Community case management (CCM) uses trained and supervised community health workers to improve access to, quality of and demand for effective case management. Evidence that CCM programs can achieve equitable improvements in coverage is limited. This cross-sectional study uses a quasi-experimental design with intervention and comparison areas. Outcomes of a CCM program for malaria and diarrhoea operating in two districts of Cameroon were measured after 1 year of implementation. A household census (N = 16 954) provided measurement of treatment-seeking behaviour for recent episodes of fever and diarrhoea. Results were compared between areas using chi-square tests. Intervention-area children with fever or diarrhoea were nearly nine times more likely to receive treatment with artemisinin combination therapy or oral rehydration salts, respectively, vs neighbouring comparison-area children. High levels of effective treatment were equitable across socioeconomic status in intervention areas, whereas disparities were observed in neighbouring comparison areas. CCM can achieve rapid and equitable improvements in coverage of case management for malaria and diarrhoea, and is a promising strategy for achieving MDG 4. Improved access to treatment, quality of care and caregiver demand were achieved in two districts of Cameroon.

Relatively little is known about the longer-term impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on children’s daily functioning, especially the broader outcome domain referred to as health-related quality of life (HRQL). The objective of the present study was to examine the nature and predictors of HRQL outcomes in children with moderate to severe TBI an average of 4 years postinjury. Methods. The study used a concurrent cohort-prospective design involving postinjury assessments of 3 groups of traumatically injured children and their families including 42 with severe TBI, 42 with moderate TBI, and 50 with orthopedic injuries only. Parent and child perceptions of HRQL and child adaptive behavior measures were obtained along with parent descriptions of the child’s health problems and use of medical and mental health services. Predictors included indices of injury severity, social factors, and ratings of preinjury child behavior problems and school performance. Results. Based on parent report, adolescents who sustained severe TBI had lower HRQL related to overall psychosocial functioning and in the domains of behavior, mental health, general health, and family impact than adolescents who sustained orthopedic injuries only. Communication skills, daily living skills, and general adaptive functioning also were rated lower in the severe TBI group. In contrast to parent reports, adolescents with severe TBI did not rate their HRQL in most domains differently than did adolescents with orthopedic injuries. There were no group differences in frequency of persistent physical limitations. Sixty-seven percent of families of children with severe TBI used mental health counseling at some point after the injury. Risks for poorer HRQL outcomes were related to family social disadvantage and poorer preinjury child behavioral and academic functioning. Conclusions. Findings underscore the importance of using comprehensive measures of HRQL, along with traditional indicators of functional outcomes, when evaluating the longer-term impact of injuries in children. Identification of predictors suggests the need for close monitoring and intervention of high-risk children.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[5.518650141311809e-07, 0.0001319622970186174, 8.49218758958159e-06, 0.9999885559082031, 3.511815123147244e-07, 0.9192734360694885, 0.9999980926513672, 7.32490434529609e-07, 7.399997343782161e-07]"

283,"the epidemiology of cosmetic treatments for corneal opacities in a korean population Purpose: To describe etiologies and clinical characteristics of corneal opacities leading patients to seek cosmetic treatments. Methods: The medical records of 401 patients who presented for cosmetic improvement in corneal opacities between May 2004 and July 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The following parameters were analyzed: age, gender, cause of corneal opacity, time course of the corneal disease, associated diseases, prior and current cosmetic treatments, visual acuity, location and depth of the corneal opacity, and the presence of either corneal neovascularization or band keratopathy. A single practitioner examined all patients. Results: The most common causes of corneal opacity were ocular trauma (203 eyes, 50.6%), retinal disease (62 eyes, 15.5%), measles (38 eyes, 9.5%), and congenital etiologies (22 eyes, 5.5%). Prior treatments included iris colored contact lenses (125 eyes, 31.1%) and corneal tattooing (34 eyes, 8.46%). A total of 321 of 401 eyes underwent cosmetic treatment for corneal opacities. The most common treatment performed after the primary visit was corneal tattooing (261 eyes, 64.92%). Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the causes and clinical characteristics of patients presenting for cosmetic treatment of corneal opacities rather than for functional improvement. Various cosmetic interventions are available for patients with corneal opacities, and these should be individualized for the needs of each patient.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[8.104503876893432e-07, 1.1871121614603908e-06, 1.1630200788204093e-05, 0.9995463490486145, 3.81298775664618e-07, 2.5142494450847153e-06, 1.0939343155769166e-05, 7.048061547720863e-07, 0.0012171048438176513]"
284,"the well london program a cluster randomized trial of community engagement for improving health behaviors and mental wellbeing baseline survey results BACKGROUND: The Well London program used community engagement, complemented by changes to the physical and social neighborhood environment, to improve physical activity levels, healthy eating, and mental wellbeing in the most deprived communities in London. The effectiveness of Well London is being evaluated in a pair-matched cluster randomized trial (CRT). The baseline survey data are reported here. METHODS: The CRT involved 20 matched pairs of intervention and control communities (defined as UK census lower super output areas (LSOAs); ranked in the 11% most deprived LSOAs in London by the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation) across 20 London boroughs. The primary trial outcomes, sociodemographic information, and environmental neighbourhood characteristics were assessed in three quantitative components within the Well London CRT at baseline: a cross-sectional, interviewer-administered adult household survey; a self-completed, school-based adolescent questionnaire; a fieldworker completed neighborhood environmental audit. Baseline data collection occurred in 2008. Physical activity, healthy eating, and mental wellbeing were assessed using standardized, validated questionnaire tools. Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data in the outcomes and other variables in the adult and adolescent surveys. RESULTS: There were 4,107 adults and 1,214 adolescent respondents in the baseline surveys. The intervention and control areas were broadly comparable with respect to the primary outcomes and key sociodemographic characteristics. The environmental characteristics of the intervention and control neighborhoods were broadly similar. There was greater between-cluster variation in the primary outcomes in the adult population compared to the adolescent population. Levels of healthy eating, smoking, and self-reported anxiety/depression were similar in the Well London adult population and the national Health Survey for England. Levels of physical activity were higher in the Well London adult population but this is likely to be due to the different measurement tools used in the two surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Randomization of social interventions such as Well London is acceptable and feasible and in this study the intervention and control arms are well-balanced with respect to the primary outcomes and key sociodemographic characteristics. The matched design has improved the statistical efficiency of the study amongst adults but less so amongst adolescents.

285,"the transition to motherhood in an organizational context an interpretative phenomenological analysis Most of the extant literature on maternity issues is survey based, primarily concerned with identifying the predictors of return to work. The current study aims instead to understand experiences of maternity leave per se. Of the 10 women interviewed during pregnancy, 8 women were followed through to their return to work. Their interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify transitional themes. Findings are discussed in terms of two master themes: changes of identity (involving feelings of gradual invisibility as a valued employee, acquisition of a ‘mother’ identity creating return dilemmas and efforts to revalidate oneself upon re-entry as both a valued employee and a mother); and changed psychological contracts (pertaining to the fulfilment of mutual expectations). Overall, women appeared to struggle subjectively with prevailing their rights, needs and concerns as mothers while simultaneously also maintaining their identity as valued and functional members of the organization. The findings can be conceptualized within existing theoretical frameworks (e.g. Psychological Contract Theory) and to this extent it is possible to draw out implications for a more effective management of the transition process from pregnancy to return to work.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[8.68248662300175e-06, 0.999987006187439, 5.542551662074402e-05, 0.9999805688858032, 3.6703750083688647e-07, 0.0017503632698208094, 1.199457074108068e-06, 8.896371923583501e-07, 0.0016501882346346974]"
286,"building capacity for community based participatory research for health disparities in canada the case of partnerships in community health research Enthusiasm for community-based participatory research (CBPR) is increasing among health researchers and practitioners in addressing health disparities. Although there are many benefits of CBPR, such as its ability to democratize knowledge and link research to community action and social change, there are also perils that researchers can encounter that can threaten the integrity of the research and undermine relationships. Despite the increasing demand for CBPR-qualified individuals, few programs exist that are capable of facilitating in-depth and experiential training for both students and those working in communities. This article reviews the Partnerships in Community Health Research (PCHR), a training program at the University of British Columbia that between 2001 and 2009 has equipped graduate student and community-based learners with knowledge, skills, and experience to engage together more effectively using CBPR. With case studies of PCHR learner projects, this article illustrates some of the important successes and lessons learned in preparing CBPR-qualified researchers and community-based professionals in Canada.

288,"insulin pump use in young children in the t1d exchange clinic registry is associated with lower hemoglobin a1c levels than injection therapy Insulin delivery via injection and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via insulin pump were compared in a cross-sectional study (n = 669) and retrospective longitudinal study (n = 1904) of young children (<6 yr) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) participating in the T1D Exchange clinic registry. Use of CSII correlated with longer T1D duration (p < 0.001), higher parental education (p < 0.001), and annual household income (p < 0.006) but not with race/ethnicity. Wide variation in pump use was observed among T1D Exchange centers even after adjusting for these factors, suggesting that prescriber preference is a substantial determinant of CSII use. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was lower in pump vs. injection users (7.9 vs. 8.5%, adjusted p < 0.001) in the cross-sectional study. In the longitudinal study, HbA1c decreased after initiation of CSII by 0.2%, on average (p < 0.001). Frequency of a severe hypoglycemia (SH) event did not differ in pump vs. injection users (p = 0.2). Frequency of ≥1 parent-reported diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) event in the prior year was greater in pump users than injection users (10 vs. 8%, p = 0.04). No differences between pump and injection users were observed for clinic-reported DKA events. Children below 6 yr have many unique metabolic characteristics, feeding behaviors, and care needs compared with older children and adolescents. These data support the use of insulin pumps in this youngest age group, and suggest that metabolic control may be improved without increasing the frequency of SH, but care should be taken as to the possibly increased risk of DKA.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 0.999998927116394, 0.04917747899889946, 0.9999794960021973, 3.4188010999969265e-07, 0.9982191920280457, 0.9999991655349731, 6.62716843180533e-07, 5.44808585800638e-07]"

During the first 31 weeks, 53 breast-feeding women attended and consent was sought to send an anonymous postal questionnaire six weeks after their first attendance. Content analysis and descriptive statistics have been used. Findings : the response rate to the questionnaire was 87% (45/52) with 76% of respondents (34/45) reporting that they were still breast feeding. Only four women had discontinued for the reason for which they had initially attended the group. While the greatest value of the group was considered by the women to relate to its function in supporting breast feeding, 46% (141/305) of the aspects identified by them as being ‘good related to issues of a predominantly psychosocial nature.

292,"the impact of macromastia on adolescents a cross sectional study OBJECTIVE: To determine the physical and psychosocial impact of macromastia on adolescents considering reduction mammaplasty in comparison with healthy adolescents. METHODS: The following surveys were administered to adolescents with macromastia and control subjects, aged 12 to 21 years: Short-Form 36v2, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Breast-Related Symptoms Questionnaire, and Eating-Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26). Demographic variables and self-reported breast symptoms were compared between the 2 groups. Linear regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for BMI category (normal weight, overweight, obese), were fit to determine the effect of case status on survey score. Odds ratios for the risk of disordered eating behaviors (EAT-26 score ≥20) in cases versus controls were also determined. RESULTS: Ninety-six subjects with macromastia and 103 control subjects participated in this study. Age was similar between groups, but subjects with macromastia had a higher BMI ( P = .02). Adolescents with macromastia had lower Short-Form 36v2 domain, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Breast-Related Symptoms Questionnaire scores and higher EAT-26 scores compared with controls. Macromastia was also associated with a higher risk of disordered eating behaviors. In almost all cases, the impact of macromastia was independent of BMI category. CONCLUSIONS: Macromastia has a substantial negative impact on health-related quality of life, self-esteem, physical symptoms, and eating behaviors in adolescents with this condition. These observations were largely independent of BMI category.

294,"randomized controlled trial of mammography intervention in insured very low income women Background: The expectation that insurance coverage mitigates health disparities and equalizes use of healthcare assumes that services are equally accessed; however, the insured low-income target population in this research had a mammography rate of 23.4%, well below the general population. Our objective was to determine the most effective intervention to improve mammography use in low-income women insured by a managed care organization (MCO). Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial. Participants were 2,357 women noncompliant with screening mammography randomly assigned to one of three groups: control ( n = 786) received usual care; simple intervention ( n = 785) received prompt letter from the MCO medical director; and stepwise intervention ( n = 786) received the same prompt letter from the MCO; if noncompliant, a second prompt letter from their primary care physician and, if still noncompliant, counseling from lay health workers. Outcome was completion of screening mammography extracted from medical records. Results: Screening rates were 13.4% for the control, 16.1% for the simple intervention, and 27.1% for the stepwise intervention. Compared with the control, the primary care physician letter in the stepwise intervention increased the likelihood of screening by 80% [Relative Risk (RR) = 1.80; P < 0.001], and counseling tripled the likelihood of screening (RR = 3.11; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared with the control and simple intervention, a stepwise intervention to increase mammography is effective in a target population of hard-to-reach, low-income, insured women. Impact: The research provides evidence for the impact of stepwise interventions to improve cancer screening in low-income insured populations, although the screening rates remain well below those of the general population.

Methods We report 12-month results of an Internet-based diabetes self-management program, with and without additional support, compared to enhanced usual care in a 3-arm practical randomized trial. Patients (n = 463) were randomized: 77.3% completed 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were changes in health behaviors of healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. Secondary outcomes were hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, lipids, blood pressure, and psychosocial factors. Results Internet conditions improved health behaviors significantly vs. usual care over the 12-month period (d for effect size = .09–.16). All conditions improved moderately on biological and psychosocial outcomes. Latinos, lower literacy, and higher cardiovascular disease risk patients improved as much as other participants. Conclusions The Internet intervention meets the reach and feasibility criteria for a potentially broad public health impact. However, 12-month magnitude of effects was small, suggesting that different or more intensive approaches are necessary to support long-term outcomes. Research is needed to understand the linkages between intervention and maintenance processes and downstream outcomes.

Results and Conclusions The HRs for low income status are larger for colon cancer (2.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.80), followed by stomach (1.67, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.78), liver (1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39) and lung cancers (1.46, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.14). In the model including the variable of healthcare utilisation, colon and stomach cancers exhibited a lower HR in the moderate healthcare utilisation groups (0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.76 in colon; 0.59, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.96 in stomach), whereas for liver cancer, the high utilisation group exhibited a higher hazard (1.72, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.75). A lower income status is independently related to a shorter survival time in cancer patients, especially in less fatal cancers. Healthcare utilisation independently affects the likelihood of survival from colon and stomach cancers, implying that a moderate degree of healthcare utilisation contributes to a longer survival time.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[6.150971785245929e-07, 1.0456445806994452e-06, 0.011443961411714554, 4.677548531617504e-06, 3.5915104490413796e-07, 0.6084979772567749, 0.9999990463256836, 5.263985372039315e-07, 8.235201676143333e-07]"
297,"technical and compliance considerations for mobile health self monitoring of glucose and blood pressure for patients with diabetes Self-monitoring of blood glucose is an integral part of diabetes care which may be extended to other biometrics. Cellular and short range communication technologies will be important for the routine usage of these systems. However, the issues of follow-up and patient compliance with these emerging systems have not been yet studied evaluated but could be critical to the adoption of these technologies. We evaluated the impact of mobile telemonitoring on the intensification of care on blood pressure control and exposure to hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes. We randomised 137 patients with diabetes to either mobile telemonitoring (n = 3D72) or usual care patients (n = 3D65) for 9 months.

299,"meeting the challenges of implementing process evaluation within randomized controlled trials the example of assist a stop smoking in schools trial It is increasingly argued that the effectiveness of health promotion interventions should be measured to inform policy and practice. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) continues to be regarded as the ‘gold standard’ of health services research but health promotion practitioners have raised concerns about the RCT’s appropriateness for evaluating their work. A preferred model is currently the pragmatic trial, measuring effectiveness under ‘routine’ conditions, incorporating a process evaluation to examine context, implementation and receipt. This model was chosen by A Stop Smoking in Schools Trial (ASSIST) to evaluate an intervention in which influential Year 8 students (12–13 years old) were trained to encourage non-smoking behaviour through informal conversations with their peers. Outcome data show that the intervention was effective in reducing smoking levels in intervention schools compared with control schools. In this paper we describe the extensive process evaluation embedded within the trial and, rather than focusing on resultant data, we consider the potential for such detailed examination of process to affect the intervention’s delivery, receipt and outcome evaluation. We describe how some acknowledged challenges were addressed within ASSIST, which have relevance for future similar trials: Hawthorne effects, overlapping roles within the team and distinguishing between the intervention and its evaluation.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999971389770508, 0.999985933303833, 8.655253623146564e-06, 6.0283305174380075e-06, 3.5118856089866313e-07, 0.9999892711639404, 8.313162106787786e-05, 4.7462359020755684e-07, 7.90191904798121e-07]"
300,"progressive strength training in older patients after hip fracture a randomised controlled trial Objective: the aim of this study was to assess the effect of a 12-week once-a-week prolonged strength-training programme in a group of home-dwelling older hip fracture patients. Design: randomised, controlled; single-blind parallel-group trial. Setting: intervention at outpatient’s clinic. Subjects: 95 patients with surgical fixation for a hip fracture completed a preceding 3-month progressive strength-training programme twice a week. Methods: the programme comprised four exercises, performed at 80% of maximum capacity. Measurements were taken after 12 weeks of intervention. Outcome measurements were Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the sit-to-stand test, timed up-andgo test, maximal gait speed, 6-min walk test, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale and the Short Form-12 questionnaire. Results: we found no statistically significant difference between groups in the primary outcome BBS, presumably because of a ceiling effect. The intervention group showed significant improvements in strength, gait speed and gait distance, instrumental activities of daily living and self-rated health. Conclusions: twelve weeks of progressive strength training performed once a week, as a follow-up to a more intensive training period, seemed to improve strength and endurance and resulted in better self-reported NEADL and self-rated health after hip fracture. Hip fracture patients seem to constitute a group that needs long-term follow-up to achieve the improvements necessary for independent functioning.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.9999961853027344, 2.5981203179981094e-06, 2.9562843337771483e-05, 0.9999799728393555, 3.396847887415788e-07, 2.8588640361704165e-06, 6.982390345910972e-07, 0.9984886646270752, 0.0021741073578596115]"

302,"hop n after school project an obesity prevention randomized controlled trial This paper reports the primary outcomes of the Healthy Opportunities for Physical Activity and Nutrition (HOP N) after-school project, which was an effectiveness trial designed to evaluate the prevention of childhood obesity through building the capacity of after-school staff to increase physical activity (PA) and fruit and vegetable (FV) opportunities. We conducted a three-year, nested cross-sectional group randomized controlled effectiveness trial. After a baseline assessment year (2005-2006), schools and their after-school programs were randomized to the HOP N after-school program (n = 4) or control (n = 3), and assessed for two subsequent years (intervention year 1, 2006-2007; intervention year 2, 2007-2008). Across the three years, 715 fourth grade students, and 246 third and fourth grade after-school program participants were included in the study. HOP N included community government human service agency (Cooperative Extension) led community development efforts, a three-time yearly training of after-school staff, daily PA for 30 minutes following CATCH guidelines, a daily healthful snack, and a weekly nutrition and PA curriculum (HOP N Club). Child outcomes included change in age- and gender-specific body mass index z-scores (BMIz) across the school year and PA during after-school time measured by accelerometers. The success of HOP N in changing after-school program opportunities was evaluated by observations over the school year of after-school program physical activity sessions and snack FV offerings. Data were analyzed in 2009. The intervention had no impact on changes in BMIz. Overweight/obese children attending HOP N after-school programs performed 5.92 minutes more moderate-to-vigorous PA per day after intervention, which eliminated a baseline year deficit of 9.65 minutes per day (p < 0.05) compared to control site overweight/obese children. Active recreation program time at HOP N sites was 23.40 minutes (intervention year 1, p = 0.01) and 14.20 minutes (intervention year 2, p = 0.10) greater than control sites. HOP N sites and control sites did not differ in the number of FV offered as snacks. The HOP N program had a positive impact on overweight/obese children s PA and after-school active recreation time.

304,"effects of a mobile phone short message service on antiretroviral treatment adherence in kenya weltel kenya1 a randomised trial Summary Background Mobile (cell) phone communication has been suggested as a method to improve delivery of health services. However, data on the effects of mobile health technology on patient outcomes in resource-limited settings are limited. We aimed to assess whether mobile phone communication between health-care workers and patients starting antiretroviral therapy in Kenya improved drug adherence and suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA load. Methods WelTel Kenya1 was a multisite randomised clinical trial of HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in three clinics in Kenya. Patients were randomised (1:1) by simple randomisation with a random number generating program to a mobile phone short message service (SMS) intervention or standard care. Patients in the intervention group received weekly SMS messages from a clinic nurse and were required to respond within 48 h. Randomisation, laboratory assays, and analyses were done by investigators masked to treatment allocation; however, study participants and clinic staff were not masked to treatment. Primary outcomes were self-reported ART adherence (>95% of prescribed doses in the past 30 days at both 6 and 12 month follow-up visits) and plasma HIV-1 viral RNA load suppression ( Findings Between May, 2007, and October, 2008, we randomly assigned 538 participants to the SMS intervention (n=273) or to standard care (n=265). Adherence to ART was reported in 168 of 273 patients receiving the SMS intervention compared with 132 of 265 in the control group (relative risk [RR] for non-adherence 0·81, 95% CI 0·69–0·94; p=0·006). Suppressed viral loads were reported in 156 of 273 patients in the SMS group and 128 of 265 in the control group, (RR for virologic failure 0·84, 95% CI 0·71–0·99; p=0·04). The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve greater than 95% adherence was nine (95% CI 5·0–29·5) and the NNT to achieve viral load suppression was 11 (5·8–227·3). Interpretation Patients who received SMS support had significantly improved ART adherence and rates of viral suppression compared with the control individuals.

Design, setting and participants: We used participants from a longitudinal study of a representative sample of the adult (≥16 years old) population of Barcelona (336 men and 400 women). The field work was conducted between May 2013 and February 2014. We computed the prevalence, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The prevalence of ever e-cigarette use was 6.5% (95% CI 4.7% to 8.3%): 1.6% current use, 2.2% past use and 2.7% only e-cigarette experimentation. 75% (95% CI 62.8% to 87.3%) of ever e-cigarette users were current cigarette smokers at the moment of the interview. E-cigarette use was more likely among current smokers (OR=54.57; 95% CI 7.33 to 406.38) and highly dependent cigarette smokers (OR=3.96; 95% CI 1.60 to 9.82). 62.5% of the ever users charged their e-cigarettes with nicotine with 70% of them obtaining the liquids with nicotine in a specialised shop. 39.6% of ever e-cigarette users were not satisfied with their use, a similar percentage of not satisfied expressing the smokers (38.9%) and there were no statistically significant differences in the satisfaction between the users of e-cigarettes with and without nicotine.

Design A quasiexperimental field trial with 6 intervention and 8 matched control schools. Outcomes were assessed longitudinally using preintervention (fall 1995) and follow-up (spring 1997) student survey food frequency and activity measures and follow-up 24-hour recall measures of diet and activity. Change was also assessed using yearly repeated cross-sectional surveys of all grade 5 students from 1995 through 1997. Participants Longitudinal data were collected from 479 students initially in grade 4 in Baltimore, Md, public schools; 91% were African American. Repeated 24-hour recall measures in 1997 were collected for a random subsample of 336 students. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from all grade 5 students in 1995, 1996, and 1997 (n=2103). Intervention The Eat Well and Keep Moving Program was taught by classroom teachers over 2 years in math, science, language arts, and social studies classes. Materials provided links to school food services and families and provided training and wellness programs for teachers and other staff members. Intervention materials focused on decreasing consumption of foods high in total and saturated fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake, as well as reducing television viewing and increasing physical activity. Main Outcome Measures Dietary intake and physical activity measured via repeated 24-hour recall were primary end points, with additional food frequency and activity measures. Results The 24-hour recall measures indicated that, after controlling for baseline covariates, the percentages of total energy from fat and saturated fat were reduced among students in intervention compared with control schools (−1.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.8 to −0.04; P =.04 and −0.60%; 95% CI, −1.2 to −0.01; P =.05). There was an increase in fruit and vegetable intake (0.36 servings/4184 kJ; 95% CI, 0.10-0.62; P =.01), in vitamin C intake (8.8 mg/4184 kJ; 95% CI, 2.0-16; P =.01), and in fiber consumption (0.7 g/4184 kJ; 95% CI, 0.0-1.4; P =.05).

Most studies report that people are generally happy with the outcome of cosmetic procedures, but little rigorous evaluation has been done. More extensive ( type change ) procedures (eg, rhinoplasty) appear to require greater psychological adjustment by the patient than restorative procedures (eg, face-lift).

312,"a randomized trial of directly administered antiretroviral therapy and adherence case management intervention Background. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of a directly administered antiretroviral therapy program (DAART) and intensive adherence case management (IACM) intervention on virologic and immunologic response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among patients at 3 public human immunodeficiency virus clinics in Los Angeles County, California. Methods. Participants included 250 treatment-naive and treatment-experienced persons for whom no more than 1 prior HAART regimen had failed. Five days per week for 6 months, a community worker delivered 1 HAART dose to DAART participants and observed the participant take it. IACM participants met weekly with a case manager to overcome barriers to HAART adherence. A control group (the standard of care [SOC] group) received the usual care. Results. The majority of patients were Latino (64%) or African American (24%); 57% were monolingual Spanish speakers. Seventy-five percent of the patients were male, and 64% reported an annual income of !$10,000. In an intent-to-treat analysis, no statistical differences were observed in the percentage of patients with an undetectable viral load (i.e., !400 copies/mL) at 6 months between the DAART group (54%), IACM group (60%), and SOC group (54%; ). An on-treatment analysis determined that there were no statistical differences in P 1 .05 the percentage of patients with an undetectable viral load at 6 months between the DAART group (71%), IACM group (80%), and SOC group (74%; ). Additionally, there were no statistical differences in 6-month changes P 1 .05 in the CD4 + cell count or in self-reported adherence to therapy. Conclusions. Among patients with limited prior HAART experience and adherence barriers that had not been assessed before randomization, no differences were found in virologic or immunologic response for DAART or IACM, compared with SOC, at 6 months. DAART and IACM did not improve short-term outcomes when SOC included other means of adherence support that were not controlled for by the study design.","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[7.927028491394594e-05, 0.9999991655349731, 0.00040911679388955235, 0.02527710050344467, 3.4036347074106743e-07, 0.0055357287637889385, 1.8094245888278238e-06, 6.903662779222941e-07, 0.9999977350234985]"
313,"efficacy of iron fortified ultra rice in improving the iron status of women in mexico Background: Universal fortification of staple foods with iron has been widely promoted as a cost-effective strategy to reduce iron deficiency in developing-country populations. Nonetheless, relatively few efficacy trials have been reported to date to demonstrate impact on iron status. The Ultra Rice technology provides a means of delivering fortificant iron via rice. Objective: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of rice fortified with microencapsulated, micronized iron pyrophosphate to improve the iron status of women in Mexico in a randomized, controlled intervention trial. Methods: Nonpregnant, nonlactating women 18 to 49 years of age were recruited from six factories. The women received a daily portion of cooked rice 5 days per week for a period of 6 months, before and after which iron status indicators were determined in venous blood samples. Results: The average intake of iron from the fortificant was 13 mg/day. Mean plasma ferritin concentration and estimated body iron stores were significantly higher, and transferrin receptors were lower, in the iron-fortified rice group following the intervention. Mean hemoglobin concentration also increased in the treatment group, but the increase was significant only when the analysis was restricted to those with baseline hemoglobin < 12.8 g/dL. The absolute reduction in anemia and iron deficiency was 10.3 and 15.1 percentage points, respectively. Total iron intake from fortificant was a significant covariate of change in body iron stores. The overall prevalence of anemia was reduced by 80%. Conclusions: Fortification of rice with iron using this technology is an efficacious strategy for preventing iron deficiency.","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999996423721313, 0.9997571110725403, 0.9977003931999207, 0.9999775886535645, 4.759561988976202e-07, 1.5692017768742517e-05, 0.9964630007743835, 7.683053695473063e-07, 5.923499770688068e-07]"
314,"challenges and rewards of involving community in research an overview of the focus on kids hiv risk reduction program Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continues to be a significant concern for adolescents, especially in minority populations. There is a scarcity of knowledge of the cultural context of sexual behavior in this age group and the influences that lead to early initiation of sex and unsafe sex. Few efforts targeting young adolescents have been community based, although there has been an increased awareness of the need for such research and intervention programs. Four key processes have been defined in gaining community participation in health education programs: (a) defining the community and reaching the community; (b) recognizing tensions among service, research, and community participation; (c) involving community residents; and (d) considering cultural differences in a community. These processes are used to describe the Focus on Kids project, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk reduction intervention that resulted in significant increases in condom use demonstrated by a randomized controlled trial.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[6.093938509366126e-07, 0.5626657605171204, 2.3203401724458672e-05, 4.4338253246678505e-06, 3.4181653063569684e-07, 2.9005079795751953e-06, 0.0005619167350232601, 8.102958304334607e-07, 0.9999067783355713]"

We categorized countries into four regions: UK, USA, Other Euro-American countries (OEAC) and (RoW). OEAC were European countries other than the UK but including Australia, New Zealand and Canada. RoW comprised all other countries. The average contribution of the RoW to the research literature in the five journals was 6.5%. In the two British journals 7.6% of the articles were from the RoW; in the three American journals 4.8% of articles were from RoW. The highest proportion of papers from the RoW was in the Lancet (12%). An analysis of the authorship of 151 articles from RoW showed that 104 (68.9%) involved authorship with developed countries in Europe or North America.

318,"differences in impact between a family versus an individual based tailored intervention to reduce fat intake The present study investigates the impact of a tailored nutrition intervention on the reduction of fat intake and on psychosocial determinants of fat intake. Furthermore, differences in impact between a family-based intervention (tailoring two family members, one adult and one child, simultaneously) and an individual-based intervention (tailoring one family member, one adult or one child) were studied. Analyses were conducted among 180 respondents, comparing 44 adolescents in the family condition with 50 adolescents in the individual condition and 44 parents in the family condition with 40 parents in the individual condition. Respondents in both conditions reported positive reactions towards the tailored fat feedback letters. Tailored fat feedback resulted in significantly more positive psychosocial determinants of fat intake and, among respondents with high fat intake at baseline, in a significant decrease in percent energy from fat. Parents in the family-based intervention group reported higher social support scores at post-test. No differences in post-test fat intake were found between the two study conditions. It is concluded that the results further illustrate the potential of tailored fat feedback, but the results do not provide evidence for superiority of family-based tailoring above individual-based tailored interventions for fat.

326,"effect of a behaviour change intervention on handwashing with soap in india superamma a cluster randomised trial Summary Background Diarrhoea and respiratory infections are the two biggest causes of child death globally. Handwashing with soap could substantially reduce diarrhoea and respiratory infections, but prevalence of adequate handwashing is low. We tested whether a scalable village-level intervention based on emotional drivers of behaviour, rather than knowledge, could improve handwashing behaviour in rural India. Methods The study was done in Chittoor district in southern Andhra Pradesh, India, between May 24, 2011, and Sept 10, 2012. Eligible villages had a population of 700–2000 people, a state-run primary school for children aged 8–13 years, and a preschool for children younger than 5 years. 14 villages (clusters) were selected, stratified by population size ( vs >1200), and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control (no intervention). Clusters were enrolled by the study manager. Random allocation was done by the study statistician using a random number generator. The intervention included community and school-based events incorporating an animated film, skits, and public pledging ceremonies. Outcomes were measured by direct observation in 20–25 households per village at baseline and at three follow-up visits (6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention). Observers had no connection with the intervention and observers and participant households were told that the study was about domestic water use to reduce the risk of bias. No other masking was possible. The primary outcome was the proportion of handwashing with soap at key events (after defecation, after cleaning a child s bottom, before food preparation, and before eating) at all follow-up visits. The control villages received a shortened version of the intervention before the final follow-up round. Outcome data are presented as village-level means. Findings Handwashing with soap at key events was rare at baseline in both the intervention and control groups (1% [SD 1] vs 2% [1]). At 6 weeks follow-up, handwashing with soap at key events was more common in the intervention group than in the control group (19% [SD 21] vs 4% [2]; difference 15%, p=0·005). At the 6-month follow-up visit, the proportion handwashing with soap was 37% (SD 7) in the intervention group versus 6% (3) in the control group (difference 31%; p=0·02). At the 12-month follow-up visit, after the control villages had received the shortened intervention, the proportion handwashing with soap was 29% (SD 9) in the intervention group and 29% (13) in the control group. Interpretation This study shows that substantial increases in handwashing with soap can be achieved using a scalable intervention based on emotional drivers.

The evaluation focused on whether members of the Network felt they were involved equally and whether the Network acted as a forum for the exchange of information, and facilitated the involvement of local people in decision-making. A cobweb exercise identified three process categories which needed further exploration: commitment, community involvement and communication. Although the majority view was that all parties were committed to the Network, local residents did not believe that their views were reflected in many of the decisions made, and expressed concern that often the language used, both written and verbal, contained jargon which excluded some members.

329,"science faculty s subtle gender biases favor male students Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants’ preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[4.886420015282056e-07, 1.121523951042036e-06, 8.416929631493986e-06, 0.9999933242797852, 3.653151736671134e-07, 2.2947349407331785e-06, 8.671395903547818e-07, 6.189903842823696e-07, 5.828817961628374e-07]"

332,"the relationship between body mass index and self concept among adolescent black female university students The study investigated the relationship between body mass index and self-concept among adolescent black female university students. The study used a mixed research design (quantitative and qualitative methods). Media images of handsome faces and beautiful bodies are used to sell almost everything, from clothes and cosmetic to luncheon, meats, and so on. These images reinforce the western cultural stereotype that women should be thin and shapely to be attractive. Thus, as some girls go through puberty they may become dissatisfied with their weight, and to a lesser extent, with their shape, thus, developing low self-concept or imae of themselves. It is in this context that the study was conceptualised. First year female students from three different Schools and Faculties at the University of Limpopo, Turfloop Campus, South Africa, participated in the study. Using the availability and convenient sampling method, 75 students were selected for this study. For the quantitative aspect of the study, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Measure was used to measure self-esteem. For the qualitative part, a topic guide was used for the focus group discussions. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the Pearson s Product Moment Correlation were used to analyse the quantitative data, while the phenomenological principle of open coding used for the thematic analysis. Results showed that there is a relationship between body mass and self-concept and that overweight participants tend to have a low self-esteem. Low self-esteem was perceived to be aggravated by a number of factors, like the attitude of the media and the society. Participants who are overweight also indicated that they are limited in certain activities of daily living (e.g., sports) as a result of their body mass. They expressed mixed feelings and frustration when it comes to such activities. The above results did not differ from those reported from western cultures. Support groups, life-skills programmes and psychotherapy should be made available and attainable for overweight female adolescent students.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[2.485502818672103e-06, 0.9999949932098389, 1.0003708666772582e-05, 0.9999885559082031, 3.4912613955384586e-07, 0.001553382258862257, 8.585668638261268e-07, 6.319481258287851e-07, 1.0522810498514445e-06]"

At neither follow-up were there significant positive changes in sexual behavior; Youths in treatment and control groups were equally likely to have become sexually active, and youths in treatment groups were not less likely than youths in control groups to report a pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection.

Design Cochrane systematic review. Multiple electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from inception to November 2013). Hand searching of references was also performed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses reporting on interventions targeting appropriate polypharmacy in older people in any healthcare setting were included if they used a validated measure of prescribing appropriateness. Evidence quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Setting All healthcare settings. Participants Older people (≥65 years) with ≥1 long-term condition who were receiving polypharmacy (≥4 regular medicines). Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcomes were the change in prevalence of appropriate polypharmacy and hospital admissions. Medication-related problems (eg, adverse drug reactions), medication adherence and quality of life were included as secondary outcomes. Results 12 studies were included: 8 RCTs, 2 cluster RCTs and 2 controlled before-and-after studies. 1 study involved computerised decision support and 11 comprised pharmaceutical care approaches across various settings. Appropriateness was measured using validated tools, including the Medication Appropriateness Index, Beers’ criteria and Screening Tool of Older Person9s Prescriptions (STOPP)/ Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (START). The interventions demonstrated a reduction in inappropriate prescribing. Evidence of effect on hospital admissions and medication-related problems was conflicting. No differences in health-related quality of life were reported. Conclusions The included interventions demonstrated improvements in appropriate polypharmacy based on reductions in inappropriate prescribing. However, it remains unclear if interventions resulted in clinically significant improvements (eg, in terms of hospital admissions).

338,"5 a day achievement badge for urban boy scouts formative evaluation results Abstract Background. Certain cancers are more common among African Americans (AA). Fruit and vegetables (F&V) reduce cancer risk, but Americans, and African Americans in particular, do not meet the “5 A Day” goal. Scouting organizations, particularly urban Boy Scout groups that target inner‐city youth, provide promising channels for nutritional behavioral change programs. Methods. Focus groups were conducted with urban Boy Scouts and their parents to identify factors influencing F&V consumption and evaluate potential intervention activities. Twenty‐four‐hour dietary recalls were collected from 85 area Boy Scouts. A national data set was used to obtain values for F&V consumption by African American and European American (boys age 10‐16). Results. Vegetable preferences were low and a negative peer influence for vegetables was reported. The group has limited food‐preparation skills, but both parents and scouts reported that F&V were available in their homes.

339,"trends and comparison of female first authorship in high impact medical journals observational study 1994 2014 Objective To examine changes in representation of women among first authors of original research published in high impact general medical journals from 1994 to 2014 and investigate differences between journals. Design Observational study. Study sample All original research articles published in Annals of Internal Medicine , Archives of Internal Medicine, The BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) for one issue every alternate month from February 1994 to June 2014. Main exposures Time and journal of publication. Main outcome measures Prevalence of female first authorship and its adjusted association with time of publication and journal, assessed using a multivariable logistic regression model that accounted for number of authors, study type and specialty/topic, continent where the study was conducted, and the interactions between journal and time of publication, study type, and continent. Estimates from this model were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios against the mean across the six journals, with 95% confidence intervals and P values to describe the associations of interest. Results The gender of the first author was determined for 3758 of the 3860 articles considered; 1273 (34%) were women. After adjustment, female first authorship increased significantly from 27% in 1994 to 37% in 2014 (P NEJM seemed to follow a different pattern, with female first authorship decreasing; it also seemed to decline in recent years in The BMJ but started substantially higher (approximately 40%), and The BMJ had the highest total proportion of female first authors. Compared with the mean across all six journals, first authors were significantly less likely to be female in the NEJM (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.89) and significantly more likely to be female in The BMJ (1.30, 1.01 to 1.66) over the study period. Conclusions The representation of women among first authors of original research in high impact general medical journals was significantly higher in 2014 than 20 years ago, but it has plateaued in recent years and has declined in some journals. These results, along with the significant differences seen between journals, suggest that underrepresentation of research by women in high impact journals is still an important concern. The underlying causes need to be investigated to help to identify practices and strategies to increase women’s influence on and contributions to the evidence that will determine future healthcare policies and standards of clinical practice.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[6.713477773701015e-07, 8.387181651414721e-07, 7.344697223743424e-06, 0.9999908208847046, 3.3745203609214514e-07, 1.6347509017577977e-06, 1.3336498341232073e-06, 5.350370315682085e-07, 6.08217533226707e-07]"

Methods: Repeated cross-sectional survey of 10 867 schoolchildren in 304 primary schools in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Children provided saliva for cotinine assay, completing questionnaires before and 12 months after legislation. Results: SHS exposure was highest, and private smoking restrictions least frequently reported, among lower SES children. Proportions of saliva samples containing 3 ng/ml cotinine.

342,"implementation and operational research effectiveness and patient acceptability of a sexually transmitted infection self testing program in an hiv care setting Background Rates of screening for bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) among men who have sex with men in HIV care settings remain low despite high prevalence of these infections. STI self-testing may help increase screening rates in clinical settings. Methods We implemented an STI self-testing program at a large, urban HIV care clinic and evaluated its effectiveness and acceptability. We compared measures obtained during the first year of the STI self-testing program (Intervention Year, April 1, 2013-March 31, 2014) to Baseline Year (January 1, 2012-December 31, 2012) to determine: (1) overall clinic change in STI testing coverage and diagnostic yield and; (2) program-specific outcomes including appropriate anatomic site screening and patient-reported acceptability. Results Overall, testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia increased significantly between Baseline and Intervention Year, and 50% more gonococcal and 47% more chlamydial infections were detected. Syphilis testing coverage remained unchanged. Nearly 95% of 350 men who participated in the STI self-testing program completed site-specific testing appropriately based on self-reported exposures, and 92% rated their self-testing experience as good or very good. Conclusions STI self-testing in HIV care settings significantly increases testing coverage and detection of gonorrhea and chlamydia, and the program is acceptable to patients.

345,"improving service delivery of water sanitation and hygiene in primary schools a cluster randomized trial in western kenya Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs in schools have been shown to improve health and reduce absence. In resource-poor settings, barriers such as inadequate budgets, lack of oversight, and competing priorities limit effective and sustained WASH service delivery in schools. We employed a cluster-randomized trial to examine if schools could improve WASH conditions within existing administrative structures. Seventy schools were divided into a control group and three intervention groups. All intervention schools received a budget for purchasing WASH-related items. One group received no further intervention. A second group received additional funding for hiring a WASH attendant and making repairs to WASH infrastructure, and a third group was given guides for student and community monitoring of conditions. Intervention schools made significant improvements in provision of soap and handwashing water, treated drinking water, and clean latrines compared with controls. Teachers reported benefits of monitoring, repairs, and a WASH attendant, but quantitative data of WASH conditions did not determine whether expanded interventions out-performed our budget-only intervention.

346,"analysis of hiv testing acceptance and risk factors of an adolescent cohort using emergency department based multimedia hiv testing and counseling Background The social environment in the Bronx, NY, has led to HIV infection rates among young people that are much higher than the national average. Methods A prospective observational study on a convenience sample of medically stable emergency department (ED) patients was conducted from October 1, 2005, to August 31, 2012. Acceptability of the tested model was determined by assessing the number of patients tested and identified HIV infections. Data were compared with data from the rest of the ED that tested for HIV. Results A total of 10,149 adolescents were approached during this period, of which 9.5% refused or were ineligible to test. Of those approached, 38.9% of patients were male, 59.7% were Hispanic, and 33.6% were black. The mean age was 19.4 ± 1.4 years, and 8.2% of patients were men who have sex with men. For risk behavior profiles, 24.3% never used condoms in the past 3 months. Incidence of HIV was less than 1%, and 92.6% of HIV-positive patients were linked to care. Of the patients who completed a postsatisfaction survey, 82.4% felt influenced to change their sexual practices. Results A smaller percentage of adolescent had tested previously for HIV compared with nonadolescents (67.7% vs. 80.6%). There was a slightly larger percentage of adolescents that accepted HIV testing compared with nonadolescents (95.4% vs. 90.8%). Adolescents who were positive for HIV were tested earlier in the progression of the disease, with higher median CD4 cell counts and lower viral loads compared with nonadolescents.

347,"moving beyond the status quo in reducing racial and ethnic disparities in children s health Dennis P. Andrulis, PhD, MPHa During the 1990s, increasing attention was focused on longstanding racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. New research and experiences from the front lines documented the extent of these differences, their costs to individuals and society, and the role the health care system plays in perpetuating them. As evidence continued to mount, policymakers, practitioners, and others intensified their interest in improving the knowledge base, skills, communication, and training around care for diverse popu lations. Since then, these and other cultural competence efforts have grown from typically small, isolated programs into more sophisticated and potentially far-reaching initiatives whose value has been strongly reaffirmed in a series of reports and recommen dations, including those from the Institute of Medicine (IOM),1 the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health,2 The Agency for Health Re search and Quality,3 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services cultural compe tence/disparities health plan language that was part of the 2003 Quality Assurance/ Performance Improvement requirements,4 numerous state issuances, and specific pro grams undertaken by providers. In many ways, having acknowledged the considerable body of evidence attesting to racial and ethnic disparities, the field is moving beyond documentation to seek and implement models and strategies to reduce them. To date, however, health care professionals and research have not tended to focus specifically on how to reduce racial and ethnic disparities affecting families and children. Such inatten tion exists in spite of the growing documentation that rates for certain conditions, such as asthma, are disproportionately higher among minority children.5 The consequences of these disparities can be profound, affecting activities of daily living, schooling, and other areas. The purpose of this article is to use information from research and other work emerging from the field of cultural competence and disparities reduction to suggest directions for research, practice, and service settings to address the needs of children. It presents 1990 and 2000 data from our project that profiled the nation s 100 largest cities and their suburban areas (defined as the metropolitan statistical areas [MSAs] sur rounding these cities) for families, children, and maternal/infant health to describe a subset of racial/ethnic disparities.6 Using these indicators and other research to docu ment progress as well as significant, continuing challenges, this article identifies four dimensions that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities: biologic/genetic factors, access, quality of care, and language and communication. Recommendations for future direc tions to address these dimensions are intended to guide practitioners and their health care settings as well as research focused on reducing disparities and improving cultural competence for this patient population.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[7.239462433972221e-07, 0.9999985694885254, 0.0001993527839658782, 3.5401758395892102e-06, 3.8429888604696316e-07, 2.4141518224496394e-06, 2.208346631960012e-05, 8.101505954982713e-07, 1.3728150634051417e-06]"

350,"limits to meritocracy gender in academic recruitment and promotion processes According to the literature, women researchers are sometimes at a disadvantage in academic recruitment due to insufficient network ties and subtle gender biases among evaluators. But how exactly do highly formal recruitment procedures allow space for mobilizing informal, potentially gendered, network ties? Focusing on the preliminary stages of recruitment, this study covers an underexposed aspect of women’s underrepresentation in academia. By combining recruitment statistics and interviews with department heads at a Danish university, it identifies a discrepancy between the institutionalized beliefs among managers in the meritocracy and the de facto functioning of the recruitment procedures. Of the vacancies for associate- and full professorships, 40% have one applicant, and 19% are announced under closed procedures with clear implications for gender stratification. The interviews reveal a myriad of factors explaining these patterns showing how department heads sometimes exploit decoupling processes to reduce external constraints on management function and ensure organizational certainty.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[7.40527809739433e-07, 9.511392136118957e-07, 0.00011780883505707607, 0.9999904632568359, 4.5873991894040955e-07, 1.8663027958609746e-06, 8.547678476134024e-07, 7.151743943722977e-07, 6.423027798518888e-07]"

In a base-line population survey, we found a small, but significant, proportion of women (10%-15%) lacking Pap smears and a larger proportion (30%-40%) lacking mammography. In a panel study following women who lacked screening at base line, there was a trend toward greater Pap smear use among younger women and a significant increase in mammography for all age groups in San Antonio compared with groups in Houston. Although there was a difference in language use between the communities, rates of newly initiated screening within the communities were similar among monolingual Spanish speakers and among those who used English, supporting the hypothesis that the program increased both groups participation in breast-cancer screening.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]","[3.795041038756608e-06, 0.9999990463256836, 8.157628144545015e-06, 3.959834884881275e-06, 3.688030858484126e-07, 0.9999514818191528, 0.9999983310699463, 4.978122092325066e-07, 1.7955148905457463e-06]"
354,"publication productivity and experience factors associated with academic rank among orthopaedic surgery faculty in the united states Background: Many factors play a role in academic promotion among orthopaedic surgeons. This study specifically examined the importance of publication productivity metrics, career duration, and sex on academic rank in orthopaedic surgery programs in the United States. Methods: Faculty at 142 civilian academic orthopaedic surgery departments in 2014 were identified. Geographic region, department size, and 3 specific faculty characteristics (sex, career duration, and academic position) were recorded. The Hirsch index (h-index), defined as the number (h) of an investigator’s publications that have been cited at least h times, was recorded for each surgeon. The m - index was also calculated by dividing the h - index by career duration in years. Thresholds for the h-index and the m - index were identified between junior and senior academic ranks. Multivariate analysis was used to determine whether the 3 physician factors correlated independently with academic rank. Results: The analysis included 4,663 orthopaedic surgeons at 142 academic institutions (24.7% clinical faculty and 75.3% academic faculty). Among academic faculty, the median h - index was 5, the median career duration was 15 years, and the median m - index was 0.37. Thresholds between junior and senior faculty status were 12 for the h - index and 0.51 for the m-index. Female academic faculty had a lower median h-index (3 compared with 5; p < 0.001) and career duration (10 years compared with 16 years; p < 0.001) than male academic faculty, but had a similar median m-index (0.33 compared with 0.38; p = 0.103). A higher h-index and longer career duration correlated independently with an increased probability of senior academic rank (p < 0.001), but sex did not (p = 0.217). Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates that a higher h-index and m - index correlate with a higher academic orthopaedic faculty rank. Although female surgeons had a lower median h - index and a shorter median career duration than male surgeons, their m - index was not significantly different, and thus sex was not an independent predictor for senior academic rank. The identified thresholds (h-index of 12 and m-index of 0.51) between junior and senior academic ranks may be considered as factors in promotion considerations.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[5.245954071142478e-07, 8.788684908722644e-07, 1.2233288543939125e-05, 0.999992847442627, 3.3846404789983353e-07, 1.6788472976259072e-06, 6.739740570083086e-07, 8.203909374060459e-07, 1.1525125955813564e-06]"

In four of the five sites, the workshop curriculum was a version of Be Proud! Be Responsible! (Jemmott, Jemmott, & McCaffree, 1996) that had been tailored to fit the needs of local target audiences. This article describes the evaluation of the PMI workshops. Protective effects on several behavioral determinants and behavioral outcome measures were observed 1 month after the workshops.

357,"effect of a cancer screening intervention conducted by lay health workers among inner city women Introduction We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine if an in-home educational intervention conducted by lay health workers (LHWs) could increase adherence among low-income, inner-city, African-American women to breast and cervical cancer screening schedules. Methods We recruited 321 African-American women from diverse inner-city sources. After baseline interviews, they were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 163) or the control (n = 158) group. Those in the intervention group were visited in their homes up to three times by LHWs who provided a culturally sensitive educational program that emphasized the need for screening. Results Ninety-three (93) women in the intervention group and 102 in the control group completed the postintervention interview. For Pap smears, the increase in screening was similar in both groups. For clinical breast exams (CBEs), however, there was a modest increase in the intervention group. The improvement was greatest for mammography, for which there was a 10% to 12 % increase. Among women who were not on recommended schedules at baseline, the improvement was substantial and greater in the intervention group. Conclusions LHWs’ intervention appeared to improve the rate at which inner-city women obtained CBEs and mammograms, but had no effect on Pap smears. A high attrition rate weakened our ability to make conclusive statements about the exact impact of the intervention.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.030724389478564262, 0.9999990463256836, 1.378540946461726e-05, 4.4839757720183115e-06, 3.646976267646096e-07, 3.059848677366972e-05, 0.9999991655349731, 6.159764893709507e-07, 7.239158730953932e-05]"

Each issue of the newsletter (named Baby Express ) contains topics relevant to the particular stage of the child s life, and is delivered free to the home monthly in the first year and bi-monthly in the second and third years, when it is renamed Toddler Express . Baby Express is a glossy, eight-page, easy-to-read newsletter, which focuses on emotional development, parent interaction and play. Topics covered include father-related content, such as the father s role in caring for their child and father-child relationships. As part of a randomised controlled study of new parents, fathers were invited to complete a postal questionnaire at the one year follow-up; 42 of 75 fathers responded (56%). The findings showed that fathers wanted to be more involved in caring for their child, and felt it was important to obtain information that would help them to do this. A total of 37(88%) had read Baby Express and all of the fathers who read it thought it was relevant to dads. We concluded that Baby Express is as effective an information tool for fathers as for mothers, but additional material for fathers would be valuable.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relevance of socio-demographic characteristics on the presence of Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facilities, air releases, and prevalence and resolution of air quality complaints in the 20-county Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). We found that there were 4.7% more minority residents in census tracts where TRI facilities were located.

The estimated reduction in the amount of chemicals emitted per release associated with population of females with a college degree was 18.53 pounds (p < 0.01). Complaints took longer to resolve in census tracts with higher Hispanic populations (OR = 1.031, 95% CI: 1.010-1.054).

This study examined the process of implementing a new volunteer led walking group scheme in a deprived community in England with poor physical activity, health and socio-economic indicators. Documentary evidence and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and volunteer walk leaders undertaken at the beginning and end of the funding period were analysed thematically. It was found that utilising community-based assets, forming collaborative partnerships with health and non-health organisations and ongoing sustainability issues were all factors that affected the scheme s effective implementation. Passive recruitment methods and mass publicity did not attract participants who were representative of their community. The findings firstly suggest the necessity of identifying and mobilising community based assets at the ‘grass roots’ in deprived communities during the preparatory stage to access those in greatest need and to plan and build capacity. Secondly, the findings highlight the key role that health professionals have in referring those in poorest health and the inactive into walking interventions. In the new era of fiscally constrained public health embedded within local authorities these findings are pertinent in supporting the utilisation of local assets to address entrenched physical inactivity and inequity within deprived communities.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[2.10074085771339e-06, 0.009027459658682346, 0.0004551082674879581, 1.05746248664218e-05, 3.56645813326395e-07, 5.347877504391363e-06, 0.9999985694885254, 3.244828349124873e-06, 6.99278898537159e-05]"

Methods: The study sample comprised 366 young adult orthodontic patients (153 men, 213 women; age range, 21-25 years). Each participant was assessed for orthodontic treatment need and oral health-related quality of life by using the dental health component of orthodontic treatment need index and the shortened version of oral health impact profile questionnaire. Results: Orthodontic patients who had little or no, borderline, and actual need for orthodontic treatment represented 14.8%, 56%, and 29.2% of the total sample, respectively. Orthodontic treatment need significantly affected mouth aching, self-consciousness, tension, embarrassment, irritability, and life satisfaction in both sexes. Also, orthodontic treatment need significantly affected taste and relaxation in both men and women. However, pronunciation and the ability to do jobs or function effectively were not significantly associated with orthodontic treatment needs in either sex.

The poor outcomes cause negative impact on the person’s physical functioning and quality of life and put a financial burden on society. Rehabilitation is important to improve physical functioning after hip fracture. To maintain the continuity in rehabilitation we have an assumption that it is of utmost importance to continue and progress the functional training that already started at the hospital, while the patients are transferred to short-term stays in a nursing home before they are returning to home. The aim presently is to examine the effects of a functional training program, initiated by the physiotherapist and performed by the nurses, on physical functioning while the patients are at short term stays in primary health care. Inclusion and randomization will take place during hospital stay. All patients 65 years or above who have sustained a hip fracture are eligible, except if they have a score on Mini Mental State (MMS-E) of less than 15, could walk less than 10 m prior to the fracture, or are terminally ill. The intervention consists of additional functional training as part of the habitual daily routine during short term stays at nursing homes after discharge from hospital. The primary outcome is physical functioning measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes are Timed “Up & Go” (TUG), hand grip strength, activPAL accelerometer, and self-reported measures like new Mobility Score (NMS), Walking Habits, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Fall efficacy scale (FES), EuroQol health status measure (EQ-5D-5 L), and pain.

368,"the australasian diabetes data network first national audit of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes Objectives: To assess glycaemic control, anthropometry and insulin regimens in a national sample of Australian children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of de-identified, prospectively collected data from the Australasian Diabetes Data Network (ADDN) registry. Setting: Five paediatric diabetes centres in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Participants: Children and adolescents (aged 18 years or under) with type 1 diabetes of at least 12 months’ duration for whom data were added to the ADDN registry during 2015. Main outcome measures: Glycaemic control was assessed by measuring haemoglobin A(HbA) levels. Body mass index standard deviation scores (BMI-SDS) were calculated according to the CDC-2000 reference; overweight and obesity were defined by International Obesity Task Force guidelines. Insulin regimens were classified as twice-daily injections (BD), multiple daily injections (MDI; at least three injection times per day), or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Results: The mean age of the 3279 participants was 12.8 years (SD, 3.7), mean diabetes duration was 5.7 years (SD, 3.7), and mean HbAlevel 67 mmol/mol (SD, 15); only 27% achieved the national HbAtarget of less than 58 mmol/mol. The mean HbAlevel was lower in children under 6 (63 mmol/mol) than in adolescents (14e18 years; 69 mmol/mol). Mean BMI-SDS for all participants was 0.6 (SD, 0.9); 33% of the participants were overweight or obese. 44% were treated with CSII, 38% with MDI, 18% with BD. Conclusions: Most Australian children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes are not meeting the recognised HbAtarget. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is high. There is an urgent need to identify barriers to achieving optimal glycaemic control in this population.","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999995231628418, 2.5755648493941408e-06, 1.169321512861643e-05, 0.9999860525131226, 3.4343887023169373e-07, 3.2209431992669124e-06, 1.2074369806214236e-06, 6.072727956052404e-07, 5.125849042997288e-07]"
369,"micronutrient fortified milk and academic performance among chinese middle school students a cluster randomized controlled trial Many children suffer from nutritional deficiencies that may negatively affect their academic performance. This cluster-randomized controlled trial aimed to test the effects of micronutrient-fortified milk in Chinese students. Participants received either micronutrient-fortified (n = 177) or unfortified (n = 183) milk for six months. Academic performance, motivation, and learning strategies were estimated by end-of-term tests and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for micronutrients. In total, 296 students (82.2%) completed this study. Compared with the control group, students in the intervention group reported higher scores in several academic subjects (p < 0.05), including languages, mathematics, ethics, and physical performance at the end of follow-up. Students in the intervention group showed greater self-efficacy and use of cognitive strategies in learning, and reported less test anxiety (p < 0.001). Moreover, vitamin B2 deficiency (odds ratio (OR) = 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11~0.30) and iron deficiency (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14~0.81) were less likely in the students of the intervention group, whereas vitamin D, vitamin B12, and selenium deficiencies were not significantly different. Cognitive strategy had a partial mediating effect on the test scores of English (95% CI: 1.26~3.79) and Chinese (95% CI: 0.53~2.21). Our findings suggest that micronutrient-fortified milk may improve students academic performance, motivation, and learning strategies.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999990463256836, 6.822361683589406e-06, 0.8373407125473022, 0.9999805688858032, 7.188922950263077e-07, 1.9279568732599728e-05, 7.754902071610559e-06, 6.290019314292294e-07, 5.714840654036379e-07]"

371,"impact of periodic follow up testing among urban american indian women with impaired fasting glucose INTRODUCTION Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) often progresses to type 2 diabetes. Given the severity and prevalence of this disease, primary prevention is important. Intensive lifestyle counseling interventions have delayed or prevented the onset of type 2 diabetes, but it is not known whether less intensive, more easily replicable efforts can also be effective. METHODS In a lifestyle intervention study designed to reduce risks for type 2 diabetes, 200 American Indian women without diabetes, aged 18 to 40 years, were recruited from an urban community without regard to weight or IFG and block-randomized into intervention and control groups on the basis of fasting blood glucose (FBG). Dietary and physical activity behaviors were reported, and clinical metabolic, fitness, and body composition measures were taken at baseline and at periodic follow-up through 18 months. American Indian facilitators used a group-discussion format during the first 6 months to deliver a culturally influenced educational intervention on healthy eating, physical activity, social support, and goal setting. We analyzed a subset of young American Indian women with IFG at baseline (n = 42), selected from both the intervention and control groups. RESULTS Among the women with IFG, mean FBG significantly decreased from baseline to follow-up (P < .001) and converted to normal (<5.6 mmol/L or <100 mg/dL) in 62.0% of the 30 women who completed the 18-month follow-up, irrespective of participation in the group educational sessions. Other improved metabolic values included significant decreases in mean fasting blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The women reported significant overall mean decreases in intake of total energy, saturated fat, total fat, total sugar, sweetened beverages, proportion of sweet foods in the diet, and hours of TV watching. CONCLUSION Volunteers with IFG in this study benefited from learning their FBG values and reporting their dietary patterns; they made dietary changes and improved their FBG and lipid profiles. If confirmed in larger samples, these results support periodic dietary and body composition assessment, as well as glucose monitoring among women with IFG.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.9999991655349731, 0.9999992847442627, 1.1151802027598023e-05, 1.7065516658476554e-05, 3.500129253097839e-07, 5.108259756525513e-06, 0.9999984502792358, 1.1319762052153237e-06, 6.562965495504614e-07]"
372,"environmental economic benefits and trade offs on sustainably certified coffee farms Abstract Coffee with diverse shade trees is recognized as conserving greater biodiversity than more intensive production methods. Sustainable certification has been proposed as an incentive to conserve shade grown coffee. With 40% of global coffee production certified as sustainable, evidence is needed to demonstrate whether certification supports the environmental benefits of shade coffee. Environmental and economic data were taken from 278 coffee farms in Nicaragua divided between non-certified and five different sustainable certifications. Farms were propensity-score matched by altitude, area of coffee and farmer education to ensure comparability between non-certified and certified farms. Farms under all certifications had better environmental characteristics than non-certified for some indicators, but none were better for all indicators. Certified farms generally received better prices than non-certified farms. Farms with different certifications had different investment strategies; C.A.F.E. Practice farms had high investment and high return strategies, while Utz and Organic farms had low investment, low productivity strategies. Tree diversity was inversely related to productivity, price and net revenue in general, but not for certified farms that received higher prices. Certification differentiates farms with better environmental characteristics and management, provides some economic benefits to most farmers, and may contribute to mitigating environment/economic trade-offs.","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999988079071045, 5.52565288671758e-05, 8.384943066630512e-05, 0.26698726415634155, 3.883589556608058e-07, 0.8071236610412598, 2.0024712284794077e-05, 1.4066964695302886e-06, 7.368730052803585e-07]"

374,"what local people examining the gallok mining conflict and the rights of the sami population in terms of justice and power Abstract The global extraction of minerals is commonly located in areas populated by indigenous people; and while conflicts between multinational corporations and local activists and indigenous people are widespread today, the understanding of their dynamics are lacking. The Swedish government’s encouragement to an expanding mining industry has caused resistance due to environmental and social implications, particularly its effect on Sami reindeer husbandry. The resistance to a mine in Gallok is based on the belief that the right to decide about land use historically falls on the Sami people, and the right to affect land use is detrimental for the survival of Sami culture and reindeer husbandry. Although the conflict may be perceived as concerning access to natural resources, we argue that the perceived environmental conflict can be viewed as part of a larger struggle over social status and recognition. Data have been collected using qualitative methods such as observations, interviews and documents. The subsequent analysis relies on a meta-theoretical framework of justice as recognition using a typology of relations of power. Our findings suggest that relations of power constitute different categories of social actors. Stakeholders like the Sami population are subordinated to more dominant stakeholders such as the government, the company and media, who have ‘more’ power or ‘different’ kinds of power ‘over’ others. Through these asymmetric power relations, historical state-Sami relations are continuously reproduced within prevailing institutions, and also in this mining conflict. Interviewees from business and the municipality testified to the discourses driven by a neoliberal and profit-focused worldview. Challenging the neoliberal discourse, other stakeholders, namely civil society and Sami, expressed an alternative discourse based on a local, traditional, cultural, environmental and anti-neoliberal worldview.","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[3.119673010587576e-06, 0.9999985694885254, 1.5104121303011198e-05, 1.042818166752113e-05, 4.3643387925840216e-07, 7.4069694164791144e-06, 1.2658532796194777e-05, 7.959854428918334e-07, 2.134211399607011e-06]"

Evaluate the effect of washing and cooking iron-fortified rice on iron retention and bioavailability. 2. Evaluate the effect of iron-fortified rice on women with iron deficiency anemia Methods 1. Iron-fortified rice (18 mg/100 g as FeSO 4 ) was cooked in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (C), rinsed and cooked (RC), fried and cooked (FC), cooked with extra water (CW), or soaked and cooked with extra water (SCW), and iron retention was determined. 2. Rice samples were cooked in Kampala, Uganda in a lab (C-Uganda) and households using traditional cooking method (TC-Uganda) and iron retention were determined. 3. Seventeen women with iron deficiency (low iron and/or low ferritin) anemia were randomized to 100 g/d of rice (two cooked 0.75 cup servings) for two weeks containing 18 mg/d iron (supplemented) or 0.5 mg/d iron (un-supplemented). Hemoglobin and hematocrit were evaluated at baseline and 2 weeks with other measures of iron metabolism. Results 1. Iron retention, from highest to lowest, was (C), (RC), (FC), (C-Uganda), (CW), (SCW) and (TC-Uganda). 2. Seventeen women were randomized and 15 completed the study (hemoglobin 10.6 ± 1.6 g, hematocrit 33.7 ± 4.1%), 9 in the iron-fortified rice group and 6 in the un-fortified rice group. The iron-fortified group had a greater increase in hemoglobin (0.82 g, p = 0.0035) and Hematocrit (1.83%, p = 0.0248) with directional differences in other measures of iron metabolism favoring the iron-fortified group.

376,"scaling up pediatric hiv testing by incorporating provider initiated hiv testing into all child health services in hurungwe district zimbabwe BACKGROUND Practical ways are needed to scale-up pediatric HIV testing in sub-Saharan Africa, where testing is usually limited to HIV-exposed children in maternal and child health clinics. METHODS We implemented an enhanced pediatric HIV testing program in 33 health facilities in Zimbabwe by integrating HIV testing into all pediatric health services. We collected individual data on children tested by having health care workers complete a program-specific child health booklet. We compared numbers of children tested before and during the program using routinely collected aggregate program data reported by health facilities. RESULTS A total of 12,556 children aged 0-5 years were recorded in child health booklets; 9431 (75.1%) had information on HIV testing, of whom 7326 (77.7%) were tested; 7167 had test results of whom 122 (1.7%) were HIV-infected. Among children seen in outpatient clinics, 82.1% were tested compared with 66.5% tested among children seen in maternal/child health clinics. Of the 122 HIV-infected children identified, 77 (63.1%) could be missed under existing pediatric testing guidelines. The number of HIV-infected children identified during the 6-month program increased by 55% compared with the prior 6-month period (RR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.96). Factors independently associated with HIV infection included being malnourished (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.7, 95% CI: 2.1 to 28.6), being exposed to TB (AOR = 8.1, 95% CI: 2.0 to 32.2), and having an HIV-infected mother (AOR = 41.6, 95% CI: 15.9 to 108.8).

377,"original articles epidemiological research on marginalized groups implies major validity challenges lesbian health as an example Objective: Several studies have suggested an increased risk of health problems among lesbian women. Evidence-based practice calls for knowledge about risks and prevalences of diseases deserving special awareness. However, research on marginalized groups raises ethical challenges from normative assumptions underlying analysis, because models are drawn from the cultural context where marginalization itself is created and recreated. Several methodological problems consequently appear. Study design and setting: In this article, we aim to explicate some challenges related to validity in epidemiological research on minority groups where members can conceal their identitydlesbian health being our case. Our approach is a case study drawing on analytic induction. Results: We demonstrate challenges related to conceptual indistinctness, internal and external validity, confounders, cultural context, type II error, and the issue of small population subgroups. As women with a lesbian orientation constitute a relatively small fraction of the population, modest measurement problems can lead to serious errors in inference about health in ‘‘lesbians.’’ Conclusion: Generalization of the findings about health to ‘‘all lesbians,’’ and comparison between ‘‘all lesbians’’ and ‘‘women in general,’’ should be undertaken with great caution.

379,"focus section health it usability applying a task technology fit model to adapt an electronic patient portal for patient work Objectives Although electronic patient portals are offered by most health care organizations, poor usability and poor fit to patient needs may pose barriers to adoption. We collaborated with an academic hospital to conduct iterative user evaluation of a newly deployed portal designed to deliver inpatient data upon hospital discharge. Methods Three evaluators applied heuristic usability evaluation and conducted 23 individual user testing sessions with patients with chronic disease or managing the care of family members with chronic disease. Evaluation and development/improvement were conducted iteratively. User testing and analysis of qualitative data were both conducted from the perspective of a task-technology fit framework, to assess the degree of fit between the portal and patient work. Results Ability to complete health information management tasks, perceived usability, and positive comments from users improved over the course of the iterative development. However, patients still encountered significant difficulties accomplishing certain tasks such as setting up proxy accounts. The problems were most severe when patients did not start with a clear understanding of tasks that they could accomplish. In exploring the portal, novice users frequently described anecdotes from their own medical history or constructed fictional narratives about a hypothetical patient. Conclusion Chronic illness imposes a significant workload on patients, and applying a task-technology framework for evaluation of a patient portal helped improve the portal s fit to patient needs.

380,"impact of the stand your ground law on gun deaths evidence of a rural urban dichotomy We explore the impact of the Stand Your Ground (SYG) law on gun deaths by degree of urbanization. Unlike firearm homicides the definition of firearm deaths does not depend on the broadening of the self-defense provision that the SYG law represents. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that the SYG law had no impact on gun deaths at the state level. However, once the U.S. states are disaggregated into portions by degree of urbanization—central city, suburb, small urban area and rural area—we find that the law increased gun deaths in the central cities and the suburbs, and had no impact in smaller urban areas and rural areas. These findings are consistent with the fact that there is a great divide between urban and rural areas in terms of ownership and usage of guns, attitudes towards guns, and the implications thereof. The finding of increased violence in the suburbs is of particular interest in the historical backdrop whereby the growth of the suburbs, to a large extent, may have been motivated by a desire to escape crime and violence.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.9999982118606567, 3.1890215268504107e-06, 9.39754827413708e-05, 5.292534297041129e-06, 3.5082570093436516e-07, 2.4889848191378405e-06, 3.4393683563394006e-06, 8.909116218092095e-07, 2.804427367664175e-06]"
381,"bundled hiv and hepatitis c testing in the emergency department a randomized controlled trial Author(s): Cowan, Ethan; Herman, Heather S.; Rahman, Sara; Zahn, Jennifer; Leider, Jason; Calderon, Yvette | Abstract: Introduction: An estimated 25% of the 1.2 million individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S. are co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends HCV testing for high-risk groups. Our goal was to measure the impact of bundled HIV and HCV testing vs. HIV testing alone on test acceptance and identification of HCV and HIV.Methods: We conducted a two-armed, randomized controlled trial on a convenience sample of 478 adult patients in the Jacobi Medical Center emergency department from December 2012 to May 2013. Participants were randomized to receive either an offer of bundled HIV/HCV testing or HIV testing alone. We compared the primary outcome, HIV test acceptance, between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included HIV and HCV prevalence, and HCV test acceptance, refusal, risk, and knowledge. Results: We found no significant difference in HIV test acceptance between the bundled HCV/HIV (91.8%) and HIV-only (90.6%) groups (p=0.642). There were also no significant differences in test acceptance based on gender, race, or ethnicity. A majority of participants (76.6%) reported at least one HCV risk factor. No participants tested positive for HIV, and one (0.5%) tested positive for HCV. Conclusion: Integrating bundled, rapid HCV/HIV testing into an established HIV testing program did not significantly impact HIV test acceptance. Future screening efforts for HCV could be integrated into current HIV testing models to target high-risk cohorts.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0823633829204482e-06, 9.953862900147215e-06, 7.2422985795128625e-06, 0.99997878074646, 0.9999977350234985, 1.650409330977709e-06, 1.3048361324763391e-06, 1.0016090072895167e-06, 1.8300308965990553e-06]"

384,"secondary school mathematics teachers views on e learning implementation barriers during the covid 19 pandemic the case of indonesia School closures in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic have left 45.5 million school students and 3.1 million teachers dependent on online teaching and learning. Online teaching and learning are an unprecedented experience for most teachers and students; consequently, they have a limited experience with it. This paper examines the views of secondary school mathematics teachers on E-learning implementation barriers during the COVID-19 pandemic at four barrier levels, namely teacher, school, curriculum and student. Furthermore, it assesses the relationship between barrier levels with teachers’ demographic background. Data was collected through an online questionnaire, involving 159 participants from lower and upper secondary schools in Indonesia. The findings of this study suggest that student level barrier had the highest impact on e-learning use. In addition, the student level barrier showed strong positive correlation with the school level barrier and curriculum level barrier. The study showed that teachers’ backgrounds had no impact on the level of barriers. This study stimulates further discussion on the way to overcome e-learning barriers whilst simultaneously maximizing benefits of E-learning during this pandemic and beyond it by highlighting the importance of students’ voices.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[1.0695760011003586e-06, 8.14470183740923e-07, 1.3853982636646833e-05, 0.9999796152114868, 6.082651111682935e-07, 1.8891594208980678e-06, 3.759967285077437e-06, 8.652742735648644e-07, 7.344889922933362e-07]"

389,"what happens when schools shut down investigating inequality in students reading behavior during covid 19 in denmark Abstract The outbreak of Covid-19 in spring 2020 shut down schools around the world and placed parents in charge of their children’s schooling. Research from the lockdown period documents that families differ in their responses to their new responsibility for their children’s homeschooling by socioeconomic status and that the Covid-19 crisis has increased educational inequality. The aim of this paper is to examine inequality in children’s reading behavior before, during and after the lockdown of schools in Denmark by analyzing new digital data from a widely used reading app combined with administrative data. Our results show, first, that students’ online reading behavior increased significantly as a consequence of the lockdown of schools, second, that there is a socioeconomic gradient in students’ reading behavior both before and during the lockdown, and, third, that inequality in reading behavior during Covid-19 increased exclusively during the first lockdown period in which schools were closed and students where taught online. Consequently, our results support the findings from previous research documenting a SES gradient in learning opportunities in homeschooling activities during the Covid-19 induced lockdown. Yet, contrary to prior research, we find only a short-term increase in inequality on children’s actual reading activity during Covid-19.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[1.2069361901012599e-06, 1.4318032981464057e-06, 1.3769472388958093e-05, 1.4802877558395267e-05, 4.4980788516113535e-07, 2.3326504106080392e-06, 0.9999158382415771, 8.926303394218849e-07, 0.00011149828787893057]"

The study included 6720 parents recruited through schools, patient organizations and social media platforms (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the UK (n = 508), Sweden (n = 1436), Spain (n = 1491), Belgium (n = 508), the Netherlands (n = 324), Germany (n = 1662) and Italy (n = 794). Many parents reported negative effects of homeschooling for themselves and their child, and many found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools. In most countries, contact with teachers was limited, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing homeschooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some negative experiences were more common in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, differences between countries and between families with and without a mental health condition were generally small, indicating that many parents across countries reported negative experiences. Some parents also reported positive experiences of homeschooling. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures may be less effective than other interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during additional waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]","[2.155385573132662e-06, 1.7682073121250141e-06, 8.016144420253113e-06, 1.21046696222038e-05, 3.814591877926432e-07, 4.862196419708198e-06, 0.9999616146087646, 8.855141118147003e-07, 0.9999990463256836]"

394,"the impact of covid 19 on education provision to indigenous people in mexico Abstract As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, measures have been taken globally to shut down schools at all levels and move education to the online arena, which entails a strong dependence on access to the internet and electronic gadgets. Measures such as these are bound to deepen already existing inequality and bring about major disruptions in the students’ learning process. In this context, the makeup of our diverse Mexican society and school communities calls for a political framework that promotes equal education and ensures a way of constructing knowledge that is accessible to all; a perspective in education that respects traditional groups and cultures, especially those who are usually financially disadvantaged, such as indigenous people. This article examines measures taken to support provision of online education, in general, and indigenous groups, in particular. The data collection approach to support the findings consisted of reviewing official websites from UNESCO, the Mexican Ministry of Education, and three states with the largest number of indigenous people (IP). The findings suggest that the production of TV programs and school booklets in indigenous languages show a considerable effort to reach out to indigenous communities throughout the country. Nevertheless, the measures taken by the national and state governments may still be deemed limited and somewhat biased in favor of monolingual students.","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[2.6339610030845506e-06, 0.9999991655349731, 0.0008935571531765163, 4.851473477174295e-06, 4.864385232394852e-07, 1.649413570703473e-05, 0.9999983310699463, 1.0228980045212666e-06, 0.00011767882097046822]"

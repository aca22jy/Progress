2524509156	comparative analysis of the poverty and profitability status of adopters and non adopters of sustainable taungya farming in ogun state		100243477 | 45355965 | 129361004 | 189326681 | 139134214 | 2781157624 | 2780117336 | 162324750 | 50522688 | 39896193 | 118518473	2685655179 | 2605220747 | 2604247630 | 2605305835 | 2628614530	This paper investigates the comparative analysis of the poverty and profitability status of adopters and non-adopters of sustainable taungya farming in Ogun State, Nigeria. Multistage sampling procedure was employed for this study. At the first stage, primary data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 160 farmers drawn from a purposive selection of two Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) zones; Ijebu east and Ilaro zones. The second stage involved the proportionate selection of five blocks from the two ADP zones and at the third stage, four cells each were randomly selected per block. However, only 155 respondents who completed all the questionnaire items were actually used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics, Foster, Greer and Thorbecke Poverty Index, and Budgetary techniques were used for data analysis. Results revealed that 62.5% of the farmers adopted taungya farming as a form of agroforestry practice, while 34.3% of the farmers were non-adopters. The estimated relative poverty line was N2627.59 per week. Poverty incidence, depth and severity among the adopters were 30.1%, 6.8% and 0.4% respectively while they were 45.4%, 26.3% and 6.9% respectively for the non-adopters. The decomposition of the poverty status according to sub-groups was equally shown. The budgetary analysis showed that the net farm income of adopters which was N249,327/ha was significantly (p<0.05) different from that of the non-adopters which was N167,391/ha. The study concluded that taungya farming improved adopter’s welfare compared to non-adopters and accounted positively in reducing poverty. This study recommended that taungya farming should be encouraged to increase rural farmers’ income, and alleviate poverty. 	01/01/2015	a	0	0		1	en	39	3		russian journal of agricultural and socio economic sciences	Sep-19	2015	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/comparative-analysis-of-the-poverty-and-profitability-status-of-adopters-and-non-adopters-of-sustainable-taungya-farming-in-ogun-state'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:scn:031261:16082020'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/scn/031261/16082020.html'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] sub-tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the effects of 4 dietary supplements for the treatment of MAM. DESIGN: Twelve community health centers in rural Mali were randomly assigned to provide to 1264 MAM children aged 6-35 mo one of 4 dietary supplements containing approximately 500 kcal/d for 12 wk: 1) ready-to-use lipid-based supplementary food (RUSF); 2) special corn-soy blend (CSB++); 3) locally processed fortified flour (Misola); or 4) locally milled flours plus oil sugar and micronutrient powder (LMF). RESULTS: In total 1178 children (93.2%) completed the study. The adjusted mean (95% CI) change in weight (kg) from baseline was greater with RUSF than with the locally processed blends and was intermediate with CSB++ [1.16 (1.08 1.24) for RUSF 1.04 (0.96 1.13) for CSB++ 0.91 (0.82 0.99) for Misola and 0.83 (0.74 0.92) for LMF; P < 0.001]. For length change RUSF and CSB++ differed significantly from LMF. Sustained recovery rates were higher with RUSF (73%) than with Misola (61%) and LMF (58%) P < 0.0001; CSB++ recovery rates (68%) did not differ from any of the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: RUSF was more effective but more costly than other dietary supplements for the treatment of MAM; CSB++ yielded intermediate results. The benefits of treatment should be considered in relation to product costs and availability.

Nonusers and part-time users of CSSs represent small proportions of the US population that have not responded to intervention efforts. Our study examined the factors contributing to nonuse or part-time use of CSSs and the effects of exposure to a class for violators of the California Child Passenger Safety (CPS) law. METHODS: Focus groups (in English and Spanish) were conducted with individuals cited for violation of the law (N = 24). A thematic analysis of notes made by an observer, supplemented by audiotapes of the sessions, was conducted. In addition, a study of the effects of exposure to a violator class on knowledge and correct CSS use was conducted among violators. Certified CPS technicians conducted the classes and interviews. Subjects were parents cited as the driver with a child of 20 to 40 pounds, between 12 and 47 months of age. One hundred subjects recruited from the class were compared with 50 subjects who did not attend a class. Follow-up home interviews, with inspection of CCS use, were conducted 3 months after payment of the fine and completion of all court requirements. Fisher s exact test was used for 2 x 2 tables, because some of the tables had small cell sizes. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used for child restraint use, knowledge, and correct use scales, because some of these variables were not normally distributed. Linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the effects of several variables on these parameters. RESULTS: Factors influencing CSS nonuse were 1) lifestyle factors, 2) transportation and trip circumstances, 3) nonparent or nondriver issues, 4) parenting style, 5) child s behavior, and 6) perceived risks of nonuse. Violator subjects were mostly Hispanic and female, with incomes of less than 30,000 dollars per year. Those exposed to the class (citation and education group) scored 1 point higher on a knowledge test and had 1 more item correct on a CSS use instrument than did the group not exposed to the class (citation only group). In the logistic model, the citation and education group scored higher on the 2 items that were corrected by the instructor during the class. CONCLUSION: Our focus group study of CPS law violators revealed that multiple complex factors influence consistent use of a CSS. The interplay of the particular vehicle, the trip circumstances, and family/parent/child factors affected the use of a CSS at the time of parent citation. Addressing transportation issues and parenting skills in CPS programs is necessary. Among parents who had been ticketed for not restraining their children, exposure to a violator class demonstrated some benefit, compared with a fine alone. Correct CSS use improved most on items corrected by the instructor. Violator classes that include  hands-on  training show promise for improving rates of correct use of CSSs. 	01/07/2004	a	0	0		1	en	114	1	10.1542/PEDS.114.1.109	pediatrics	109-115	2004	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15231916'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15231916'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/1/109?sso=1&sso_redirect_count=1&nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token'}, {'U': 'http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.114.1.109'}, {'U': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Diane_Winn/publication/8476666_Violators_of_a_child_passenger_safety_law/links/5440acf30cf21227a11bb498.pdf?disableCoverPage=true'}, {'U': 'https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/1/109.abstract'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] California, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Box 30677-00100, Nairobi, Kenya Abstract: This study evaluated the performance of tree legumes and other soil fertility management innovations used by farmers. The objectives of the study were to: examine the extent that farm attributes, typology of farmers and field management practices have affected the adaptation and use of agroforestry technologies for soil fertility management and compare the agronomic performance and farmer assessment of agroforestry and other soil fertility management options, across a wide range of farmer types and field conditions, with a view to establishing the contribution of management variables to variations in yield estimation. Maize yield and farmer rating were assessed in Type II (researcher-designed, farmer-managed), Type III (farmer-designed and managed) trials and extension farmers. Results from 152 farmers show that agroforestry increased the yield of maize by 54-76% compared to unfertilized sole maize used as the control. When amended with fertilizer, the yield increase over the control was 73-76% across tree species. This indicates that farmers who had combined agroforestry with inorganic fertilizer experienced increase in maize yield attributable to the synergy between organic and inorganic fertilizer. In gliricidia-maize intercropping, higher maize yield was obtained by farmers who pruned twice. Combination of two prunings and fertilizer use gave the highest yield increase (148%) over the control and the third pruning was superfluous when fertilizer was applied. Without fertilizer, maize yield in agroforestry plots intercropped with pigeon pea was higher than those plots without pigeon pea. Planting date, fertilizer application, use of agroforestry and maize variety explained about 44% of the variation in maize yield on farmers  fields. 	01/01/2009	a	0	0		1	en	4	6		agricultural journal	260-271	2009	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/medwelljournals/aj/2009/260-271.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103087420'}, {'U': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oluyede_Ajayi/publication/258989053_On-farm_assessment_of_legume_fallows_and_other_fertility_management_options_used_by_smallholder_farmers_in_southern_Malawi/links/540d66e00cf2f2b29a38447a.pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] sub-tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	0

Recent interest in carbon sequestration and preliminary research suggest that well-managed pasture systems in TA could provide a good combination of economic production, poverty reduction, recovery of degraded areas and delivery of environmental services, particularly, carbon sequestration. This paper presents 3-year research results generated by the “Carbon Sequestration Project, The Netherlands Cooperation CO-01002” on soil carbon stocks (SCS) for a range of pasture and silvo-pastoral systems prevalent in agro-ecosystems of TA compared to native forest and degraded land.

The study was carried out in one of Brazil s poorest states, Ceara, in the northeast of the country. Brazil has a policy of an increased role for the population in management together with decentralised management to the local administrative (municipio) scale. For user views on health care to be useful in management, understanding their determinants needs to explore not only individual scale factors but also influences from the local health system and wider society, here termed district scale factors. The study design took different angles on users’ satisfaction to build three measures: the particular health event (termed perceived quality); a generalised perception (termed satisfaction); and, satisfaction with the Community Health Worker (termed CHW satisfaction). Potential determinants explored at the individual scale (17 variables) are grouped into: socio-demographic and economic characteristics; health outcome; health care provision; and, awareness of space for local voice in planning. Potential determinants explored at the district scale (50 variables) are grouped into: formal organisation and management (health system inputs, management capacity, outputs and outcomes); informal organisation (population awareness of health system activities, staff characteristics, district management style); and, local political culture (geographic and socio-economic population profile, commitment to the district of local leaders, norms and values of staff regarding practice).    Three determinants were key for all three user evaluation measures: getting an appointment, getting better, and the type of district (rural–urban). Our primary conclusion from this study is that there are limitations to the extent that user satisfaction can fulfill the claims made for it. On a more positive note, with these limitations noted, user satisfaction can prove a useful management tool more modestly at a local, context-specific scale. 	01/02/2005	a	0	0		1	en	60	3	10.1016/J.SOCSCIMED.2004.05.019	social science & medicine	501-513	2005	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://core.ac.uk/display/261691'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://dro.dur.ac.uk/1213/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:socmed:v:60:y:2005:i:3:p:501-513'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/15550299'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v60y2005i3p501-513.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15550299'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/individual-and-district-scale-determinants-of-users-satisfaction-with-primary-health-care-in-developing-countries(8a9aae6b-d250-41e9-bdf3-1787d0dc1f1f).html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027795360400262X'}, {'U': 'http://dro.dur.ac.uk/1213/'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] quality â€“ place of residence -	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

To address this issue, we performed retrospective data analyses on National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data for MS patient visits between 1998 and 2004. NAMCS data are a weighted estimate of the nationwide frequency of patients  outpatient clinic visits. We analyzed NAMCS data in the following categories: (1) the proportion of MS patient visits to neurologists, family practitioners or internists, (2) age/gender/race/geographical distribution patterns in patient visits, and (3) the proportion of patients on IMA treatment among established MS patients. There were an estimated 6.7 million multiple sclerosis (MS) patient visits to the clinics between 1998–2004. Neurologists recorded the most patient visits, 50.7%. Patient visits were mostly in the fourth and fifth decade age group (57.9%). The male to female ratio was 1:4. No statistical evidence was observed for a decline or increase in IMA usage. About 62% patients visiting neurologists and 92% seen by family practitioners/internists were not using IMAs. Our results suggest that between the years 1998–2003, the use of interferon-1a tended to decline while the use of interferon-1b and glatiramer acetate, increased. Strategies that lead to improved use of IMAs in the management of MS in the outpatient setting are needed. 	05/04/2007	a	0	0		1	en	5	1	10.1186/1741-7015-5-6	bmc medicine	06-Jun	2007	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1741-7015-5-6.pdf'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2007/4/5/MSDrug.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-5-6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://doi.org/10.1186%2f1741-7015-5-6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC1855349'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1741-7015-5-6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/57115854/analysis-of-namcs-data-for-multiple-sclerosis-1998-2004'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/5/6/prepub'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1855349/'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (Caucasian other) 	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age

METHODS: This was a single-blind trial. Eighty-four community-dwelling older adults with diabetes were randomized into a tailored and adaptive computerized cognitive training or a generic, non-tailored or adaptive computerized cognitive training condition. Both groups trained for 8 weeks on the commercially available CogniFit program and were supported by a range of behavior change techniques. Participants in each condition were further randomized into a global or cognition-specific self-efficacy intervention, or to a no self-efficacy condition. The primary outcome was global cognition immediately following the intervention. Secondary outcomes included diabetes self-management, meta-memory, mood, and self-efficacy. Assessments were conducted at baseline, immediately after the training, and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Adherence and retention were lower in the generic computerized cognitive training condition, but the self-efficacy intervention was not associated with adherence. Moderate improvements in performance on a global cognitive composite at the posttreatment assessments were observed in both cognitive training conditions, with further small improvement observed at the 6-month follow-up. Results for diabetes self-management showed a modest improvement on self-rated diabetes care for both intervention conditions following the treatment, which was maintained at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that older adults at higher dementia risk due to diabetes can show improvements in both cognition and disease self-management following home-based multidomain computerized cognitive training. These findings also suggest that adaptive difficulty and individual task tailoring may not be critical components of such interventions.

This study examines whether NGO facilitation of the government s community-based health programme improved the equity of maternal and newborn health in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. A quasi-experimental study design included one intervention district and one comparison district of rural Uttar Pradesh. A household survey conducted between January and June 2003 established baseline rates of programme coverage, maternal and newborn care practices, and health care utilization during 2001-02. An endline household survey was conducted after 30 months of programme implementation between January and March 2006 to measure the same indicators during 2004-05. The changes in the indicators from baseline to endline in the intervention and comparison districts were calculated by socio-economic quintiles, and concentration indices were constructed to measure the equity of programme indicators. The equity of programme coverage and antenatal and newborn care practices improved from baseline to endline in the intervention district while showing little change in the comparison district. Equity in health care utilization for mothers and newborns also showed some improvements in the intervention district, but notable socio-economic differentials remained, with the poor demonstrating less ability to access health services. NGO facilitation of government programmes is a feasible strategy to improve equity of maternal and neonatal health programmes. Improvements in equity were most pronounced for household practices, and inequities were still apparent in health care utilization. Furthermore, overall programme coverage remained low, limiting the ability to address equity. Programmes need to identify and address barriers to universal coverage and care utilization, particularly in the poorest segments of the population. 	01/07/2008	a	0	0		1	en	23	4	10.1093/HEAPOL/CZN012	health policy and planning	234-243	2008	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/4/234.full'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.commonhealth.in/pdf/34.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/23/4/234/566038'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/18562458'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/ngo-facilitation-of-a-government-community-based-maternal-and-neo-4'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18562458/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562458'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] empowerment â€“ SES +	0	0

Limited evidence supports home-based treatment of newborn infections by community health workers (CHW). METHODS : In one study arm of a cluster randomized controlled trial, CHWs assessed neonates at home, using a 20-sign clinical algorithm and classified sick neonates as having very severe disease or possible very severe disease. Over a 2-year period, 10,585 live births were recorded in the study area. CHWs assessed 8474 (80%) of the neonates within the first week of life and referred neonates with signs of severe disease. If referral failed but parents consented to home treatment, CHWs treated neonates with very severe disease or possible very severe disease with multiple signs, using injectable antibiotics. RESULTS : For very severe disease, referral compliance was 34% (162/478 cases), and home treatment acceptance was 43% (204/478 cases). The case fatality rate was 4.4% (9/204) for CHW treatment, 14.2% (23/162) for treatment by qualified medical providers, and 28.5% (32/112) for those who received no treatment or who were treated by other unqualified providers. After controlling for differences in background characteristics and illness signs among treatment groups, newborns treated by CHWs had a hazard ratio of 0.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07-0.71) for death during the neonatal period and those treated by qualified providers had a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% CI = 0.37-0.99), compared with newborns who received no treatment or were treated by untrained providers. Significantly increased hazards ratios of death were observed for neonates with convulsions (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.54; 95% CI = 3.98-10.76), chest in-drawing (HR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.29-4.39), temperature <35.3 degrees C (HR = 3.47, 95% CI = 1.30-9.24), and unconsciousness (HR = 7.92, 95% CI = 3.13-20.04). CONCLUSIONS : Home treatment of very severe disease in neonates by CHWs was effective and acceptable in a low-resource setting in Bangladesh. 	01/04/2009	a	0	0		1	en	28	4	10.1097/INF.0B013E31819069E8	pediatric infectious disease journal	304-310	2009	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929171'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2929171/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/effectiveness-of-home-based-management-of-newborn-infections-by-c-3'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19289979/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093144248'}, {'U': 'https://journals.lww.com/00006454-200904000-00010'}, {'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093144248.html'}]		0	0	0	0	0	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education +	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] access â€“ socio-economic status (SES) + utilisation â€“ SES + empowerment â€“ SES +	0	0

METHODS: Double-blind randomized controlled trial comprised of children aged 2 to 6 years with initial hemoglobin exceeding 9 g/dL from four not-for-profit daycares randomly selected in the city of Sao Paulo - Brazil. Children of 2 daycares (n = 88) received rolls with fortified wheat flour as the exposed group (EC) and children of 2 daycares (n = 85) received rolls without fortification as the control group (CG) over a 24-week period. Rolls with 4 mg iron each were offered once a day, five days a week. Hemoglobin concentrations were determined in capillary blood by HemoCue® at three moments of trial: baseline (Ml), after 12 and 24 weeks of intervention (M2, M3). RESULTS: Hemoglobin concentration presented significant increase up to M3 in EG (11.7-12.5-12.6 g/dL) and in CG (11.1-12.4-12.3 g/dL) with higher elevations in children initially with anemia. There was significant reduction in the occurrence of anemia from 22% to 9% in EG and from 47% to 8.2% in CG at M3. CONCLUSION: Rolls fortified with microencapsulated iron sulfate were well tolerated, increased hemoglobin levels and reduced the occurrence of anemia, but with no difference compared to the control group. 	01/01/2012	a	0	0		1	en	58	1	10.1590/S0104-42302012000100024	revista da associacao medica brasileira	118-124	2012	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22392326'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22392326/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22392326'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.scielo.br/j/ramb/a/XTxTMFCxRMcKZYf44mfSfYs/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2255482312701649'}, {'U': 'http://www.scielo.br/j/ramb/a/XTxTMFCxRMcKZYf44mfSfYs/'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] urban Sao Paulo Brazil	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] school children	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] both	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] children known to be from families of low socioeconomic status	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] children aged 2 to 6 years with baseline haemoglobin exceeding 9 g/dL

An anti-malaria program in the area seeks to devolve malaria diagnosis and treatment to the VHWs. Firstly, the relationship between malaria and demographic factors, bednet use, and access to treatment was investigated. Secondly, adults from villages with and without resident VHWs were questioned on historical and proposed treatment-seeking for fever and the capacity of the communities to support more health workers was assessed. Parasite prevalence was significantly higher among patients living in villages lacking a resident VHW (adjusted OR=3.88, p=0.02), where proposed delays in consulting VHWs and the official health service, and the use of alternative medicine, were also significantly higher. Kinship or social closeness to VHWs appears to play a role in accessibility. The educational and economic requirements demanded of VHWs impede potential expansion of the program to non-serviced villages. If the effectiveness and equity of community-based treatment strategies is to be increased, increased flexibility allowing use of local, less-educated, drug dispensers needs to be considered. 	01/05/2005	a	0	0		1	en	36	3		southeast asian journal of tropical medicine and public health	578-586	2005	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16124420'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:83533d4'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] access - place of residence - utilisation â€“ place of residence -	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender +	0	Education, Education, [info] access â€“ education + utilisation â€“ education +	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] access â€“ SES -	Social capital, Social capital, [info] utilisation â€“ social capital -	0

Poorly absorbable reduced Fe powders are commonly used. Encapsulation of FeSO4 can overcome these sensory changes, but the particle size of commercial compounds is too large to be used by flour mills. The first objective of the study was to measure the efficacy in wheat flour of two newly developed Fe compounds, an H-reduced Fe powder (NutraFine RS; North America Hoganas High Alloys LLC, Johnstown, PA, USA) and small particle-sized (40 microm) encapsulated FeSO4. As a second objective, the microcapsules were evaluated as a vehicle for iodine fortification. A randomised, double-blind controlled intervention trial was conducted in Kuwaiti women (n 279; aged 18-35 years) with low body Fe stores (serum ferritin (SF) < 25 microg/l) randomly assigned to one of three groups (20 mg Fe as NutraFine RS, 10 mg Fe as encapsulated FeSO4 and 150 microg iodine, or no fortification Fe) who consumed wheat-based biscuits 5 d per week. At baseline and 22 weeks, Hb, SF, transferrin receptor, urinary iodine and body Fe stores were measured. Relative to control, mean SF in the encapsulated FeSO4 group increased by 88 % (P < 0.001) and body Fe stores increased from - 0.96 to 2.24 mg/kg body weight (P < 0.001), while NutraFine RS did not significantly increase SF or body Fe stores. The median urinary iodine concentration increased from 140 to 213 microg/l (P < 0.01). NutraFine RS added at double the amount of Fe as FeSO4 was not efficacious in improving Fe status. The newly developed microcapsules were highly efficacious in improving both Fe stores and iodine status. 	01/11/2009	a	0	0		1	en	102	9	10.1017/S0007114509990353	british journal of nutrition	1362-1369	2009	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/1B3B6B75085234036B95ADEBFE014CDD/S0007114509990353a.pdf/div-class-title-efficacy-of-wheat-based-biscuits-fortified-with-microcapsules-containing-ferrous-sulfate-and-potassium-iodate-or-a-new-hydrogen-reduced-elemental-iron-a-randomised-double-blind-controlled-trial-in-kuwaiti-women-div.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/770603'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19653920/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103024774'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/efficacy-of-wheatbased-biscuits-fortified-with-microcapsules-containing-ferrous-sulfate-and-potassium-iodate-or-a-new-hydrogenreduced-elemental-iron-a-randomised-doubleblind-controlled-trial-in-kuwaiti-women/1B3B6B75085234036B95ADEBFE014CDD'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19653920'}, {'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103024774.html'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] two colleges in Kuwait college for women Kuwait university and nursing college public authority for applied education training	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] students	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] females only	0	Education, Education, [info] college and nursing students	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] high standard of living	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Pesronal] women aged between 18 and 35 years

We aimed to assess whether reminders sent to carers by text message, mobile phone call, or concomitant text message and mobile phone call increase attendance at medical appointments for HIV care in a population of children infected with or exposed to HIV in Cameroon. We also aimed to ascertain the most cost-effective method of mobile-phone-based reminder. Methods MORE CARE was a multicentre, single-blind, factorial, randomised controlled trial in urban, semi-urban, and rural settings in Cameroon. Carers of children who were infected with or had been exposed to HIV were randomly assigned electronically in blocks of four and allocated (1:1:1:1) sequentially to receive a text message and a call, a text message only, a call only, or no reminder (control). Investigators were masked to group assignment. Text messages were sent and calls made 2 or 3 days before a scheduled follow-up appointment. The primary outcomes were efficacy (the proportion of patients attending a previously scheduled appointment) and efficiency (attendance/[measures of staff working time × cost of the reminders]), as a measure of cost-effectiveness. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Register, number PACTR201304000528276. Findings The study took place between Jan 28 and May 24, 2013. We randomly assigned 242 adult–child (carer–patient) pairs into four groups: text message plus call (n=61), call (n=60), text message (n=60), and control (n=61). 54 participants (89%) in the text message plus call group, 51 (85%) in the call group, 45 (75%) in the text message group, and 31 (51%) in the control group attended their scheduled appointment. Compared with control, the odds ratios for improvement in the primary efficacy outcome were 7·5 (95% CI 2·9–19·0; p Interpretation Mobile-phone-based reminders of scheduled HIV appointments for carers of paediatric patients in low-resource settings can increase attendance. The most effective method of reminder was text message plus phone call, but text messaging alone was the most efficient (ie, cost-effective) method.

Our aim was to investigate if DP and other factors are associated with psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior among MS patients, and whether DP is a stronger risk indicator among certain groups. A prospective population-based cohort study with six-year follow-up (2005–2010), including 11 346 MS patients who in 2004 were aged 16–64 and lived in Sweden. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. MS patients on DP had a modestly higher risk of requiring psychiatric healthcare, IRR: 1.36 (95 % CI: 1.18-1.58). MS patients with previous psychiatric healthcare had a higher IRR for both psychiatric healthcare and suicidal behavior; 2.32 (2.18-2.47) and 1.91 (1.59-2.30), respectively. DP moderated the association between sex and psychiatric healthcare, where women on DP displayed higher risk than men, X2 4.74 (p = 0.03). The findings suggest that losing one’s role in work life aggravates rather than alleviates the burden of MS, as MS patients on DP seem to have a higher need for psychiatric healthcare, especially among women; which calls for extra awareness among clinicians. 	16/11/2015	a	0	0		1	en	15	1	10.1186/S12888-015-0668-6	bmc psychiatry	286-286	2015	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12888-015-0668-6.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4647565'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1091799'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://0-bmcpsychiatry-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12888-015-0668-6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-015-0668-6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/81551731'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-015-0668-6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/74929451/is-disability-pension-a-risk-indicator-for-future-need-of-psychiatric-healthcare-or'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647565/'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-015-0668-6/fulltext.html'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] educational level ( 12 years)	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [personal] age mental health (received previous care for psychiatric diagnosis) [Relationships] social support (marital status)

Additional to the targeted improvements in attendance and educational performance, program spillover effects likely included enhanced child health, community agroforestry knowledge, increased tree planting and diversity of crops and trees, saved household income, and improved relations within the family unit and among community members. Participants suggested that increasing the community s capacity to contribute to and collaborate with the school is necessary for program sustenance and for further community development. 	01/01/2017	a	0	0		1	en	52		10.1016/J.IJEDUDEV.2016.10.005	international journal of educational development	Oct-18	2017	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeinjoed/v_3a52_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a10-18.htm'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/injoed/v52y2017icp10-18.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059316303649'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

Methods A semi-structured discussion was used to conduct 11 language specific focus groups in Arabic, Assyrian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese and Turkish. Translated transcriptions were analysed using the major concepts of the integrative behaviour change model. Results Restraint use intent among CALD community carers is related to perceived safety of their children and complying with the law. While most participants appreciated the safety benefits of correct and appropriate use, a minority did not. Child restraint legislation may positively influence social norms, and enforcement appears to increase parental self-efficacy. However, concerns over child comfort may negatively influence both norms and self-efficacy. There are clear deficits in knowledge that may act as barriers as well as confusion over best practice in safely transporting children. Large family size, vehicle size and cost appear to be real environmental constraints in CALD communities. Conclusion Determinants of intent and deficits in knowledge in this diverse range of CALD communities in NSW Australia are similar to those reported in other qualitative studies regardless of the population studied. This indicates that key messages should be the same regardless of the target population. However, for CALD communities there is a specific need to ensure access to detailed information through appropriate delivery strategies and languages. Furthermore, practical constraints such as cost of restraints and family size may be particularly important in CALD communities. 	01/02/2013	a	0	0		1	en	19	1	10.1136/INJURYPREV-2011-040211	injury prevention	06-Dec	2013	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/injuryprev/19/1/6.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22634741'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22634741'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/19/1/6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22634741/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://trid.trb.org/view/1247747'}, {'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/injuryprev-2011-040211'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] New South Wales Australia	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] 11 language specific focus groups in Arabic Assyrian Cantonese Mandarin Vietnamese and Turkish	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] ten groups were female-only and one Arabic-speaking group was male-only	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] all participants were non-English speaking in Australia and the study was hence focussed on a linguistic minority however majority also spoke English in Arabic and Assyrain group only many of them are immigrants mean duration in Australia is 10â€“20 years in different groups with the minimum being 1 year in Assyrian and Cantonese group

A total of 14009 people with MS at admission to a nursing facility were analyzed using the Minimum Data Set and 36% also had depression. This study developed profiles of nursing home residents with MS who also had depression and compared them with other residents with MS. MS residents with depression were significantly more likely to be female and younger than other MS residents, with significant racial differences as well. MS residents with depression were significantly more likely than other MS residents to have a history of mental health conditions, exhibit mood indicators, and have unsettled relationships. Both groups of MS residents had high levels of physical disability, although MS residents with depression tended to be slightly less disabled. MS residents with depression were more likely than other MS residents to experience daily pain and more likely to have the diseases common to all residents with MS. This research found that most MS residents with depression did not receive mental health services, demonstrating that nursing facilities must improve the mental healthcare provided to residents with MS with depression. 	01/04/2003	a	0	0		1	en	9	2	10.1191/1352458503MS872OA	multiple sclerosis journal	171-188	2003	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12708813'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/1352458503ms872oa'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12708813/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12708813'}, {'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/1352458503ms872oa'}, {'U': 'http://msj.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1191/1352458503ms872oa'}, {'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1352458503ms872oa'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] mental health (depression no depression)

Purpose The objectives of this study are to develop profiles of nursing home residents with MS from rural areas and compare them to residents with MS who lived in urban areas, suburban areas, and large towns. Methods We analyzed all admission assessments for residents with MS (13,357 assessments) in the Minimum Data Set between June 23, 1998, and December 31, 2000, that also had the resident s ZIP code of primary residence before admission. Findings Urban and rural comparisons of residents with MS demonstrate a range of significant demographic differences. Significantly greater proportions of MS residents from rural areas exhibited a sense of initiative or involvement in activities of the nursing facility compared with residents with MS from urban and suburban areas. The differences in the utilization of physical and occupational therapies were striking, with MS residents from rural areas averaging significantly fewer minutes of these therapies. We also found that MS residents from rural areas averaged fewer minutes of psychological therapy in the nursing facility and also were less likely to have seen a licensed mental health specialist than MS residents from urban areas. Conclusions Nursing home residents with MS from rural areas receive fewer therapies and less mental health care than residents with MS from other areas. 	01/01/2004	a	0	0		1	en	20	1	10.1111/J.1748-0361.2004.TB00012.X	journal of rural health	85-91	2004	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14964932'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ692542'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2004.tb00012.x'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14964932/'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (rural urban)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We analysed MDS admission assessments for 1367 African Americans with MS and 9294 whites with MS. African American residents with MS were significantly younger at admission than white residents with MS, with almost one half of these African Americans 50 years or younger compared to only one quarter of these whites. African American residents with MS were significantly more physically disabled and cognitively impaired at admission than white residents with MS. Although there were significant racial differences in disability, there were no significant racial differences among these MS residents in the use of various therapies provided by qualified therapists. These observed racial differences among MS residents in disease manifestations, severity, progression and disability are due to multiple variables and point out the need for more research. By combining discoveries from genetics, immunology, epidemiology and virology we can gain a better understanding of the complex pathophysiology of MS and develop more effective treatments and preventive measures. Our findings also indicate potential racial disparities in the use of MS-related care, illustrating that a greater outreach effort may be needed to evaluate and treat African Americans with MS. 	01/12/2004	a	0	0		1	en	10	6	10.1191/1352458504MS1086OA	multiple sclerosis journal	660-667	2004	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1352458504ms1086oa'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15584491/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15584491'}, {'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1352458504ms1086oa'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (White African American)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Little is known about barriers to the use of health care confronting people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in rural areas. Purpose To identify any rural/urban differences in access and barriers to health services, including MS-focused care, among people with MS. Methods The data were collected in a survey of 1,518 people with MS living in all 50 States. The study included three geographic subgroups: urban areas; adjacent rural areas; and more remote rural areas. Findings We found significant rural/urban differences in access and barriers to care among people with MS, especially for MS-focused care. Significantly smaller proportions of people with MS from adjacent and more remote rural areas reported no difficulty getting MS-related care than their urban counterparts. Conclusions Greater difficulty accessing MS-related care experienced by people with MS in rural areas has negative implications for the quality of the MS care they receive. 	01/01/2006	a	0	0		1	en	29	3		journal of health and human services administration	360-375	2006	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/17571473'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17571473/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17571473'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (rural urban)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Methods: Data were collected in a nationwide survey of 1,518 people with multiple sclerosis. Results: More than 40 percent of people with multiple sclerosis in each urban or rural area had received a diagnosis of depression, and more than 90 percent of them received mental health services,_regardless of location of residence. However, rural residents were significantly less likely than their urban counterparts to receive the recommended combined medication and psychotherapy for treatment of depression. Conclusions: Current mental health care systems, even in rural areas, are capable of reaching out to patients with neuromedical illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis. Patients perceive some limitations in quality and accessibility, and recommended treatment differs between urban and rural areas. 	01/08/2006	a	0	0		1	en	57	8	10.1176/PS.2006.57.8.1206	psychiatric services	1206-1209	2006	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16870975'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870975'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ps.2006.57.8.1206'}, {'U': 'https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=96952'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (rural urban)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

METHODS We used all admission assessments recorded in the national Minimum Data Set (MDS) from 1999 to 2001 as well as all MDS annual assessments recorded from 2000 to 2002. We matched admission assessments with first annual assessment for 3632 White residents with MS and 461 African-American residents with MS. RESULTS African Americans with MS were admitted at a significantly younger age and with more aid to daily living (ADL) dependence and cognitive dysfunction than Whites with MS one year after admission. Despite significantly poorer physical performance, cognitive function, and more medical comorbidities, African Americans with MS did not receive significantly more therapies or medications than White residents with MS after one year in the facility. CONCLUSIONS Basic differences in MS expression and progression in African Americans appear to have to do with both genetic and environmental factors. Further study will help to clarify the reasons for these differences. 	01/01/2006	a	0	0		1	en	16	1		ethnicity & disease	159-165	2006	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ishib.org/ED/journal/16-1/ethn-16-01-159.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16599365'}, {'U': 'https://www.ishib.org/ED/journal/16-1/ethn-16-01-159.pdf'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (African American white)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Method data were collected by surveying 1,518 people with MS throughout the United States, equally divided among urban, urban-adjacent rural areas, and more remote rural areas. Standard SAS procedures were used to analyze the results. Results significantly larger proportions of people with MS in rural areas had a family or general practitioner as their primary physician while a significantly larger proportion of people with MS in urban areas had a neurologist as their primary physician. Rural residents traveled significantly greater distances to receive MS-focused care than their urban counterparts. People with MS living in more remote rural areas averaged less satisfaction with their access to a neurologist and to MS-focused care, and less satisfaction with the quality of care received, than people with MS in urban areas. Conclusion limited availability of MS specialists in rural areas, and greater travel time and distance required to receive care from these providers, present future challenges to providing appropriate and high quality MS-focused care to people living with MS in rural areas. 	01/01/2006	a	0	0		1	en	21	3	10.3233/NRE-2006-21301	neurorehabilitation	177-187	2006	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://content.iospress.com/articles/neurorehabilitation/nre00315'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17167187/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17167187'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (rural urban)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

To present urban/rural analyses of health insurance coverage among people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This research also combined all survey respondents from each urban/rural area into one group of people with MS in health maintenance organizations (HMOs)/managed care and another group of people with MS who have other health insurance plans to compare any differences in coverage.Methods. We interviewed 1,518 people with MS living in all 50 states. Survey results were analyzed using SPSS.Results. Most people with MS in each urban/rural area had health insurance coverage (92 – 95%), with significant urban/rural differences observed in HMO/managed care enrollments. We found no urban/rural differences among people with MS in HMOs/managed care, or among people with MS with other health insurance plans, in satisfaction with coverage of routine care and MS-focused care, or with perceptions of how coverage enables utilization of health services. However, we found that people with MS in HMOs/managed car... 	09/02/2007	a	0	0		1	en	29	24	10.1080/09638280601178899	disability and rehabilitation	1890-1898	2007	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/17852264'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17852264'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09638280601178899'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (rural urban)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Participants We analyzed enrollment data from the Registry of the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Project to compare 26,967 Caucasians, 715 Latinos, and 1,313 African Americans with MS. Design Racial/ethnic analyses of NARCOMS data focused on descriptive characteristics, using ANOVA and chi-square tests to identify significant differences in means and frequencies among Caucasians, Latinos, and African Americans. Results We identified significant racial/ethnic differences in demographics, MS disease characteristics, and treatments. Caucasians were older when first MS symptoms were experienced (30.1 years) and at MS diagnosis (37.4 years) than Latinos (28.6 years and 34.5 years) or African Americans (29.8 years and 35.8 years). Larger proportions of Latinos reported normal function for mobility and bladder/bowel function compared to Caucasians. Larger proportions of Latinos (44.2 percent) and African Americans (45.8 percent) reported at least mild depression compared to only 38.7 percent of Caucasians. Larger proportions of Latinos never received mental health care or care from rehabilitation specialists than Caucasians or African Americans. A larger proportion of African Americans had never been treated by a neurologist specializing in MS and a smaller proportion of African Americans received care at a MS clinic than Caucasians or Latinos. Conclusions Our findings highlight the need for future analyses to determine if age, disease duration, MS symptoms, and disability levels provide additional insights into racial/ethic differences in the use of MS-related providers. 	01/01/2010	a	0	0		1	en	20	4		ethnicity & disease	451-457	2010	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21305836/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21305836'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (Caucasian Latino African American)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Objectives To measure the impact of short message service (SMS) text reminders on the reattendance rates of patients who require repeat STI testing. Methods Reattendance rates were measured for two groups of higher risk patients: those listed for routine SMS text reminders in 2012 and a control group of patients from 2011 with the same risk profile who had not received any active recall. Reattendance was counted if it was within 4 months of the end of the episode of care. Results Reattendance rates were not statistically different between the text group 32% (89/274) and the control group 35% (92/266). Reattendance also was not statistically different between the text and control groups respectively in patients with the following risks: recent chlamydia 43/121 (36%) versus 41/123 (33%), recent gonorrhoea 4/21 (19%) versus 7/21 (33%), recent emergency contraception 27/60 (45%) versus 25/56 (45%) and other risks 7/27 (26%) versus 9/26 (35%). High rates of STIs were found in patients who reattended in both the text group (13/90, 14%) and control group (15/91, 17%) and at even higher rates at reattendance if the reason for recall was chlamydia infection at the initial visit: 9/43 (21%) in the text group and 10/41 (24%) in the control group. Conclusions SMS texts sent as reminders to patients at higher risk of STIs and HIV did not increase the reattendance rate, when compared with standard advice, in this service which already has a high reattendance rate. STI rates were high in those patients who reattended. 	01/02/2014	a	0	0		1	en	90	1	10.1136/SEXTRANS-2013-051228	sexually transmitted infections	Nov-13	2014	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://sti.bmj.com/content/sextrans/90/1/11.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24064987/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://doi.org/10.1136%2fsextrans-2013-051228'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24064987'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://sti.bmj.com/content/90/1/11'}, {'U': 'https://sti.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2013-051228'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Pesronal] age

Community-based health promotion is a strategy that is believed to reduce inequities in rural low-income settings. This paper examines the contributions of community-based programming to improving the equity of newborn health in three districts in Malawi. This study is a before-and-after evaluation of Malawi’s Community-Based Maternal and Newborn Care (CBMNC) program, a package of facility and community-based interventions to improve newborn health. Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) within the catchment area of 14 health facilities were trained to make pregnancy and postnatal home visits to promote healthy behaviors and assess women and newborns for danger signs requiring referral to a facility. “Core groups” of community volunteers were also trained to raise awareness about recommended newborn care practices. Baseline and endline household surveys measured the coverage of the intervention and targeted health behaviors for this before-and-after evaluation. Wealth indices were constructed using household asset data and concentration indices were compared between baseline and endline for each indicator. The HSAs trained in the intervention reached 36.7% of women with a pregnancy home visit and 10.9% of women with a postnatal home visit within three days of delivery. Coverage of the intervention was slightly inequitable, with richer households more likely to receive one or two pregnancy home visits (concentration indices (CI) of 0.0786 and 0.0960), but not significantly more likely to receive a postnatal visit or know of a core group. Despite modest coverage levels for the intervention, health equity improved significantly over the study period for several indicators. Greater improvements in inequities were observed for knowledge indicators than for coverage of routine health services. At endline, a greater proportion of women from the poorest quintile knew three or more danger signs for pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum mothers than did women from the least poor quintile (change in CI: -0.1704, -0.2464, and -0.4166, respectively; p < 0.05). Equity also significantly improved for coverage of some health behaviors, including delivery at a health facility (change in CI: -0.0591), breastfeeding within the first hour (-0.0379), and delayed bathing (-0.0405). Although these results indicate promising improvements for newborn health in Malawi, the extent to which the CBMNC program contributed to these improvements in coverage and equity are not known. The strategies through which community-based programs are implemented likely play an important role in their ability to improve equity, and further research and program monitoring are needed to ensure that the poorest households are reached by community-based health programs. 	07/11/2013	a	0	0		1	en	13	1	10.1186/1471-2458-13-1052	bmc public health	1052-1052	2013	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1471-2458-13-1052.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-1052'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/81767498'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3833651'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/contribution-of-community-based-newborn-health-promotion-to-reduc-4'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-13-1052'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/57296396/contribution-of-community-based-newborn-health-promotion-to-reducing-inequities-in'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199832'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/{9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a}/CONTRIBUTION%20OF%20COMMUNITY-BASED%20NEWBORN%20HEALTH%20PROMOTION.PDF'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] access â€“ SES - utilisation â€“ SES ? empowerment â€“ SES +	0	0

However, the rate of child restraint use is extremely low in Chinese cities. Parent drivers could play an important role in promoting child safety restraint use, but not all of them take active responsibility. This study used a qualitative approach and included 14 in-depth interviews among parents with a child, under the age of 6, living in Shantou City (7 child safety restraint users and 7 non-users). Purposive sampling was used to recruit eligible parent drivers who participated in a previous observation study. Interview data were collected from March to April 2013. The audio taped and transcribed data were coded and analyzed to identify key themes. Four key themes on child safety restraint emerged from the in-depth interviews with parents. These included 1) Having a child safety restraint installed in the rear seat with an adult sitting next to the restrained child is ideal, and child safety restraint is seen as an alternative when adult accompaniment is not available; 2) Having effective parental education strategies could help make a difference in child safety restraint use; 3) Inadequate promotion and parents’ poor safety awareness contribute to the low rate of child safety restraint in China; 4) Mandatory legislation on child safety restraint use could be an effective approach. Inadequate promotion and low awareness of safe traveling by parents were closely linked to low child safety seat usage under the circumstance of no mandatory legislation. Future intervention efforts need to focus on increasing parents’ safe travel awareness combined with CSS product promotion before the laws are enacted. 	07/04/2014	a	0	0		1	en	14	1	10.1186/1471-2458-14-318	bmc public health	318-318	2014	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1471-2458-14-318.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-318'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/81848079'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4234189'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-14-318'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/57361385/parents-experience-with-child-safety-restraint-in-china'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://trid.trb.org/view/1307371'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4234189/'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Shanghai China	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] two of the 14 participants were fathers and the rest were mothers	0	Education, Education, [info] bachelors or higher	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] monthly income at or above average of city all drove to work using car	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] young age 29â€“34 years

Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is difficult, and methods to increase it are needed. Methods. We tested the impact of supportive telephone calls in an adherence substudy of a treatment trial. Subjects initiating antiretroviral therapy received either each site s usual adherence support measures or usual support measures and scripted serial telephone calls (16 calls during 96 weeks). Results. A total of 282 subjects enrolled: 140 in the usual support measures group and 142 in the calls group. A total of 75% of expected calls were completed. Virologic failure occurred in 97 (34%) subjects: 52 (37%) of those in the usual support measures group and 45 (32%) of those in the calls group; time to virologic failure was not different (P = .32). In each group, >72% of subjects reported ≥95% adherence, with no difference between groups. Independent predictors of higher rates of virologic failure were <95% adherence, receiving the 4-drug regimen with nelfinavir, and female sex; older age was associated with decreased likelihood of virologic failure. Receiving the 4-drug regimen with nelfinavir, higher stress scores, older age, and higher call completion rates were independently associated with higher adherence. Conclusions. Serial telephone calls did not improve virologic outcome but had an impact on self-reported adherence. 	15/10/2005	a	0	0		1	en	192	8	10.1086/466526	the journal of infectious diseases	1398-1406	2005	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16170757'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/192/8/1398/894978'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/105716320'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/a-randomized-study-of-serial-telephone-call-support-to-increase-a'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/47603542/a-randomized-study-of-serial-telephone-call-support-to-increase-adherence-and-thereby'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16170757/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16170757'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	0

Health outcomes were examined pre and postintervention using a randomized control design. The intervention group had greater improvement (p = .013) in psychological distress symptoms and greater improvement in perceived availability of social support (p = .016) than the control group. The intervention group showed less health care utilization (p = .032) than the control group. Social support interventions for women in shelters are effective in improving health outcomes. Further research should be aimed at testing the effectiveness of different types of interventions on health and abuse outcomes in women who experience interpersonal violence. 	01/07/2005	a	0	0		1	en	26	6	10.1080/01612840590959416	issues in mental health nursing	575-590	2005	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'http://www.brown.uk.com/domesticviolence/constantino.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16020071'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16020071/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://researchexperts.utmb.edu/en/publications/effects-of-a-social-support-intervention-on-health-outcomes-in-re'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://utmb.influuent.utsystem.edu/en/publications/effects-of-a-social-support-intervention-on-health-outcomes-in-re'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16020071'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01612840590959416'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] domestic violence shelter	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] most women were white not Hispanic and the rest were African Americans	Occupation, Occupation, [info] half were unemployed	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] women	0	Education, Education, [info] most of the women completed high school and three women had college degrees	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] three-quarters had annual income less than USD 20 000	0	0

In particular, the use of fertilizer trees has been promoted as a practice that contributes to improved soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, by increasing supply of nutrients for crop production. While a lot of the evidence on the impact of fertilizer trees relies on on-farm experiments and correlational analysis, there is a paucity of rigorous evidence under actual smallholder farming conditions. This paper analyzes the impacts of adopting fertilizer trees such as Gliricidia sepium and Faidherbia albida on household food security. We draw on survey data of 338 farmers in Malawi and use an endogenous switching regression to rigorously analyze adoption impacts. Econometric results show that use of fertilizer tree adoption increases the value of food crops by 35%. Disaggregation of the impacts through stratification by land ownership further reveal that farmers with smaller farms of up to 2 acres realize the highest gains. Furthermore, fertilizer tree use in conjunction with improved maize seed also significantly increased value of food crops. This study offers preliminary insights that contribute to an emerging field of research on quantitative assessment of agricultural interventions such as agroforestry practices using novel analytical approaches. We provide some policy insights and recommend the need for future research to be designed around development initiatives that consider fine-scale variation in social, economic and ecological context of farmers to improve uptake and adaptation to realize the full potential of agroforestry in improving soil fertility and household food security. 	01/01/2016	a	0	0		1	en	155		10.1016/J.AGSY.2017.03.017	agricultural systems	52-69	2016	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173276472'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308521X17303001'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17303001'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

To address this, the landcare approach, based on community landcare groups, is being piloted in several locations. The results of a study to evaluate the impact of the Landcare Program in Barangay Ned in Southern Mindanao are presented. The sustainable rural livelihoods approach was used as a framework for the evaluation. The study focused on two impacts, the adoption of conservation practices and the formation and development of landcare groups, drawing on four data sources - project reports, key informants, a questionnaire survey, and case studies of landcare groups. The Ned Landcare Program has been associated with rapid adoption of conservation farming practices and the rapid formation of landcare groups linked in an association. The main effect of the Program was to enhance human capital through practical, farmer-led training and extension, enabling farmers to incorporate soil conservation and agroforestry technologies in their farming systems, with desirable outcomes for livelihood security and environmental sustainability. The social capital formed, especially through the landcare association, was crucial to these outcomes. Ongoing partnerships with adequately resourced facilitating agencies were required to maintain the Landcare Program in the long term. 	01/01/2003	a	0	0		1	en	1	2	10.3763/IJAS.2003.0113	international journal of agricultural sustainability	141-154	2003	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10528/rc_zc_jjas_04.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://worldagroforestry.org/sea/Publications/files/paper/PP0108-04.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/14981586'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:99908'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3763/ijas.2003.0113'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

Methods We conducted door-to-door home-based testing and counseling (HBTC) in rural western Kenya (Lwak) and an informal urban settlement in Nairobi (Kibera) in 2008. After consent, eligible persons (adults and adolescents aged 13 years or older and children aged 12 years or younger, whose biologic mother was HIV-infected or deceased) received parallel fingerstick HIV rapid testing and counseling. Persons newly diagnosed with HIV were referred to care services, fingerstick blood for CD4 testing was collected, and a one-month follow-up home visit was conducted. Results Among 24,450 people who were offered HBTC, 19,966 (81.7%) accepted; 65.4% of whom were HIV-tested for the first time. Prevalence in adults aged 18 years or older being HIV-tested for the first time was 13.5% (12.6%, Kibera; 14.2%, Lwak). Among adults who reported a previously negative test, HIV prevalence was 7.4% (7.2%, Kibera; 7.6%, Lwak). Among all persons with HIV in these communities, two-thirds were newly diagnosed through HBTC. Median CD4 count among newly diagnosed adults was 403 [interquartile range (IQR) = 252-594]. Among couples, 38.0% in Kibera and 51.7% in Lwak were counseled together. Among HIV-infected people in a couple, 34.6% had an HIV-uninfected partner. Among newly diagnosed HIV-infected persons, at the one-month follow-up visit, 53.6% in Kibera and 43.6% in Lwak reported having visited an HIV patient support center. Conclusions HBTC acceptance was high and most HIV-infected persons did not previously know they had HIV. HBTC can be an effective strategy for early HIV diagnosis and treatment referral. 	01/02/2013	a	0	0		1	en	62	2	10.1097/QAI.0B013E318276BEA0	journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes		2013	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/home-based-hiv-testing-and-counseling-in-rural-and-urban-kenyan-c'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23075916/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075916'}, {'U': 'https://journals.lww.com/00126334-201302010-00020'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ place of residence -	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender -	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] utilisation â€“ age +

Methods Patients selected their problem areas in medication use and watched one of nine 2-min videos with a research assistant at a clinic or pharmacy and were given an access code to watch all the videos at their convenience. Outcomes were measured at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Results Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 84% were African American and 80% were female (mean age: 54 years). Seventy-three percent watched at least one module after the initial visit. Improved self-efficacy was associated with a decrease in concerns about medications ( r  = −0.64). Low literate patients experienced greater improvement in self-efficacy than more literate patients ( t  = 2.54, p  = 0.02). Patients’ mean number of problems declined from 6.14 to 5.03. The number of patients with high or medium adherence rose from 33% at baseline to 43% at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions A practical, customized video intervention may help improve patient self-efficacy, reduce problems with medication use, and improve medication adherence in diabetes patients. Practice implications Providers should consider implementing technology-based interventions in the clinic to address common problems that patients have with self-management. 	01/01/2017	a	0	0		1	en	100	1	10.1016/J.PEC.2016.07.024	patient education and counseling	174-178	2017	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27480530'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399116303196'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399116303196'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	0	0	Plus, Plus

Although transportation in Beijing is rapidly becoming ‘motorised’, Beijing9s population has limited awareness of or access to BPBs. Objective To explore the efficacy and acceptability of using a US-developed BPB use promotion intervention in Beijing. Design Methods were adapted from a previously executed US-based study involving parents of 3–8-year old children. Focus groups (five groups, 71 participants) elicited behavioural antecedents to BPB use and reactions to video interventions promoting BPB use: a Chinese-produced instructional video and an English-language (dubbed into Mandarin) video that delivered concrete, theoretically driven messages through a personal story. Immediately after the focus groups, participants were provided with education and a free BPB. Participants were contacted 6 weeks later via telephone about use, knowledge and attitudes. Results Chinese parents saw safety as the most important benefit of BPB use; lack of accurate knowledge about and access to BPBs were parents9 most prevalent barriers. Chinese participants described the videos as persuasive and instructional. At 6 weeks, participants remembered the messages of the English-language video, and reported BPB use increased from a baseline of 15.5% to 85.5%. Conclusions This study shows the possibility of exporting US-designed prevention interventions dubbed into Mandarin without the need to alter their original context (in this case, an African American family in a US setting) into a Chinese context. Successful cultural translation involved ensuring that the behavioural antecedents targeted in the intervention (eg, barriers and benefits) were of relevance to the Chinese population. 	01/10/2010	a	0	0		1	en	16	5	10.1136/IP.2009.023341	injury prevention	296-301	2010	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/injuryprev/16/5/296.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/16/5/296'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20921561/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/cultural-translation-acceptability-and-efficacy-of-a-us-based-inj'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://trid.trb.org/view/1085178'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103310987'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20921561'}, {'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/ip.2009.023341'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Beijing China	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] 8.5% were unemployed and rest employed (12.5% medical, 12.5% administrative, 37.5% service)	0	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] Personal: aged 31â€“35 (56.5%) and married (98.6%)

The resulting knowledge gap compromises efforts for physical therapy service planning for this population.  Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the use of and need for physical therapy services in a sample of adults with MS living in the Midwestern United States.  Design This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study.  Methods Data from telephone interviews with 1,065 people with MS, aged 45 to 90 years, were used for the study. A multinomial regression model was used to determine factors associated with use of physical therapy services (never, within the past year, more than a year ago). Logistic regression analysis examined factors associated with unmet needs for these services.  Results Thirty-six percent of the sample reported never using physical therapy services, 33% reported using physical therapy services within the past year, and 31% reported using physical therapy services more than a year prior to the interview. Factors associated with recent use of physical therapy services included living in an urban or suburban community, deteriorating MS status, experiencing problems with spasticity (ie, hypertonicity), having difficulty moving inside the house, being hospitalized in the past 6 months, and seeing a family physician. These same factors were associated with unmet needs.  Limitations Physical therapy service use was self-reported. Data were collected in 5 Midwestern states from people 45 years of age or older, which may limit generalizability.  Conclusions Factors associated with use of and need for physical therapy services reflect issues of access (geographical, referrals), MS status, and mobility difficulties. 	01/11/2010	a	0	0		1	en	90	11	10.2522/PTJ.20100072	physical therapy	1607-1618	2010	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/90/11/1607.abstract'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20798180'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article/90/11/1607/2737737'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (rural urban)	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (high school or less)	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (income adequacy)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (severity as measured by MS status and spasticity)

Over 64.6% (n = 824) of participants had attended a MS support group meeting at least once. Individuals who had never attended a group were more likely to reside in urban or suburban communities, report lower symptom interference, and fewer activity limitations. Women, individuals without a helper, and people with greater symptom interference were more likely to perceive a need for a support group.

Safe Seat, a sequential, mixed-methods study identified gaps in parental knowledge about and perceived challenges in the use of appropriate CRS and insights into the preferences of various technological approaches to deliver CRS education. Focus groups (eight groups with 21 participants) and a quantitative national survey (N = 1251) using MTurk were conducted. Although there were differences in the age, racial/ethnic background, and educational level between the focus group participants and the national sample, there was a great deal of consistency in the need for more timely and personalized information about CRS. The majority of parents did not utilize car seat check professionals although they expressed interest in and lack of knowledge about how to access these resources. Although there was some interest in an app that would be personalized and able to push just-in-time content (e.g., new guidelines, location and times of car seat checks), content that has sporadic relevance (e.g., initial installation) seemed more appropriate for a website. Stakeholder input is critical to guide the development and delivery of acceptable and useful child safety education. 	26/09/2017	a	0	0		1	en	14	10	10.3390/IJERPH14101122	international journal of environmental research and public health	1122	2017	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5664623'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28954429/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664623'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] USA	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] African American (48%)	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] female (86%)	0	Education, Education, [info] at least some college education (62%)	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] primary care practices were chosen based on geographic location to ensure variability in participant race/ethnicity community setting and SES	0	0

We evaluated the influence of predisposing, enabling and need characteristics on immunization coverage and use of health services in a population-based primary health care model called the Inclusive Health Model in rural Guatemala. We also analyzed providers’ application of treatment guidelines for children with pneumonia. A longitudinal cohort design was used from 2006 to 2009 to analyze data from the model s two demonstration sites. We found a significant positive association between families’ health risk level and their use of health care services, with the model providing more services to those with greater need. Services are not provided differentially for those families with a higher or lower wealth level or selected sociodemographic characteristics. Distance from a clinic is significantly associated with lower service use, but this constraint decreases with time. Implementation of treatment guidelines does not vary with different provider characteristics. The Inclusive Health Care model s aim of offering care equitably to families living in its catchment area is reflected in these findings. This study offers an approach and conceptual model for tracking equity in service delivery that may be applicable in other settings. 	01/09/2012	a	0	0		1	en	4	3	10.1016/J.INHE.2012.04.001	international health	220-228	2012	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://inthealth.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/220.abstract'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/4/3/220/729570'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24029403'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876341312000253'}, {'U': 'http://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/4/3/220/729570'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876341312000253'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ place of residence -	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] utilisation â€“ language + quality â€“ language +	Occupation, Occupation, [info] utilisation - occupation +	0	Religion, Religion, [info] utilisation â€“ religion -	Education, Education, [info] utilisation - education ? quality â€“ education +	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation â€“ SES +	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] [Time] utilisation â€“ risk + utilisation - age quality - age - [Relationships] utilisation - family type -

Many complain that services are inadequate and poorly coordinated. Few studies have been undertaken to support this contention and objective data are scarce. The level of services and home modifications received by people with multiple sclerosis across a broad range of disease severity has been investigated.  METHODS—As part of a quality of life study, 150 adults with clinically definite multiple sclerosis were interviewed, using a structured questionnaire, to determine their current use of outpatient and community services and the home modifications in place. Disability, handicap, and emotional status were also measured.  RESULTS—Forty five per cent of people did not receive any community services other than contact with their general practitioner. Thirty nine per cent of people with moderate and 12% with severe disability failed to receive community services. For the services received: 17% had contact with a community nurse; 33% with a care attendant or home help; 23% with a physiotherapist, 21% with an occupational therapist, and 10% with a social worker. Fifty eight per cent of people had modifications to their home as a direct result of multiple sclerosis. The relation between level of disability and number of services and adaptations received was moderate (r=0.58 and 0.54 respectively) and the relation between level of services and age (r=0.12), living alone (r=0.16), and emotional status (r=0.10) was negligible.  CONCLUSIONS—Despite a shift of emphasis from hospital to community care, and the establishment of standards of care for multiple sclerosis, many people with moderate or severe disability fail to receive assistance. These results provide evidence to support the dissatisfaction felt by people with multiple sclerosis in relation to the services they receive. It raises questions about equitable allocation of resources and highlights the urgent need for a review of community services. 	01/12/2000	a	0	0		1	en	69	6	10.1136/JNNP.69.6.728	journal of neurology neurosurgery and psychiatry	728-732	2000	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/69/6/728.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1737174'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/69/6/728'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11080223/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1737174'}, {'U': 'http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/69/6/728.abstract'}, {'U': 'http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/69/6/728.full.pdf'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] disability age [Relationships] social support

The purpose of this study was to determine whether older men and women differ in their participation rates and in their responsiveness to a health intervention. Three hundred sixty-three health maintenance organization members with osteoarthritis, 60 years of age or older, were randomly assigned to a control group or to receive social support, education, or a combination of education and social support. Of the 363 randomly assigned members, 245 completed all of the follow-up assessments. Men and women volunteered in proportion to their representation in the osteoarthritis population. Although the genders differed in several ways, the interventions were equally effective for men and women, and the study results applied to both genders. 	24/07/1997	a	0	0		1	en	25	3	10.1300/J013V25N03_05	women & health	63-81	1997	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9273984'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] women	0	0	0	0	0

Mental health issues are common in this population, yet few investigations have targeted people aging with this disease (i.e., people aged 45+). This study examined factors contributing to mental health challenges among 1282 people with MS aged 45 to 90 and the extent of mental health service use among those who reported problems. Findings showed that functional abilities, age, years since diagnosis, presence of a helper, and self-rated health are related to mental health challenges. Less than 16% of people with mental health challenges were receiving services. 	01/01/2005	a	0	0		1	en	24	2	10.7870/CJCMH-2005-0011	canadian journal of community mental health	Sep-22	2005	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cjcmh.com/doi/full/10.7870/cjcmh-2005-0011'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16774132'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (high school or less/ technical school/ bachelors degree or higher)	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (severity measured by ADL limitations) [Relationships] social support (living arrangements)

We aimed at describing the demographic and clinical characteristics of MS patients who requested treatment with DMDs, variations in their use, and the factors associated with change to second-line therapies during this decade. Methods: A retrospective cohort study with information from Subcomite Especializado de Medicamentos de Alto Impacto Sanitario y/o Economico registers. A statistical analysis was run in 2 phases: descriptive analysis of the sample using classical statistical methods, and of DMD trend by a chi-square test for linear trends; analytic analysis to examine the factors associated with change to second-line treatment (logistic regression model). Results: We selected 2,205 patients (mean age 32.12, SD 9.64; 70% females, and 86.6% remising-remitting MS (RRMS)); 1,012 patients were attended to in highly specialized MS units (45.8%); 525 in monographic units (23.8%); and 668 in general units (30.2%). DMD prescriptions increased, and glatiramer acetate was more widespread at the end of the period (35.4%). Conclusion: Variability in access to different treatments was slight. The younger the patient, the higher the risk of first-line RRMS treatment failing in female gender and first treatment with interferon. 	01/01/2016	a	0	0		1	en	75		10.1159/000446580	european neurology	274-281	2016	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27286672'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] disability (severity measured by EDSS) MS subtype

We conducted a randomized trial of a two-way, personalized daily text messaging intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among N = 105 poorly adherent HIV-positive adolescents and young adults, ages 16–29. Adherence to ART was assessed via self-reported visual analogue scale (VAS; 0–100 %) at 3 and 6-months for mean adherence level and proportion ≥90 % adherent. The average effect estimate over the 6-month intervention period was significant for ≥90 % adherence (OR = 2.12, 95 % CI 1.01–4.45, p < .05) and maintained at 12-months (6 months post-intervention). Satisfaction scores for the intervention were very high. These results suggest both feasibility and initial efficacy of this approach. Given study limitations, additional testing of this intervention as part of a larger clinical trial with objective and/or clinical outcome measures of adherence is warranted. 	01/05/2016	a	0	0		1	en	20	5	10.1007/S10461-015-1192-X	aids and behavior	1049-1059	2016	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4788595'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-015-1192-x'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26362167/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4788595/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/a-randomized-controlled-trial-of-personalized-text-message-remind'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race	0	0	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] [Time] substance abuse [Personal] [Relationships] sexual orientation

Methods We report 12-month results of an Internet-based diabetes self-management program, with and without additional support, compared to enhanced usual care in a 3-arm practical randomized trial. Patients (n = 463) were randomized: 77.3% completed 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were changes in health behaviors of healthy eating, physical activity, and medication taking. Secondary outcomes were hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, lipids, blood pressure, and psychosocial factors. Results Internet conditions improved health behaviors significantly vs. usual care over the 12-month period (d for effect size = .09–.16). All conditions improved moderately on biological and psychosocial outcomes. Latinos, lower literacy, and higher cardiovascular disease risk patients improved as much as other participants. Conclusions The Internet intervention meets the reach and feasibility criteria for a potentially broad public health impact. However, 12-month magnitude of effects was small, suggesting that different or more intensive approaches are necessary to support long-term outcomes. Research is needed to understand the linkages between intervention and maintenance processes and downstream outcomes. Practice implications Automated self-management interventions should be tailored and integrated into primary care; maintenance of patient self-management can be enhanced through links to community resources. 	01/04/2012	a	0	0		1	en	87	1	10.1016/J.PEC.2011.07.024	patient education and counseling	81-92	2012	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3253192'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://experts.nebraska.edu/en/publications/twelve-month-outcomes-of-an-internet-based-diabetes-self-manageme'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://nebraska.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/twelve-month-outcomes-of-an-internet-based-diabetes-self-manageme'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21924576/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-e0983817-9769-3365-86c3-4fe8a16d5943'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC3253192'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399111003910'}, {'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21924576'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399111003910'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	0	0	Plus, Plus

Efforts to predict success in chronic disease management programs have been generally unsuccessful. Objective. To identify patient subgroups associated with success at each of 6 steps in a diabetes self-management (DSM) program. Design. Using data from a randomized trial, recursive partitioning with signal detection analysis was used to identify subgroups associated with 6 sequential steps of program success: agreement to participate, completion of baseline, initial website engagement, 4-month behavior change, later engagement, and longer-term maintenance. Setting. The study was conducted in 5 primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Colorado. Patients. Different numbers of patients participated in each step, including 2076, 544, 270, 219, 127, and 89. All measures available were used to address success at each step. Intervention.

The effects of disease diagnosis and duration, self-care behavior, perceived helplessness, social support, treatment choice, and formal education level on outcomes among persons with arthritis who participated in these programs were evaluated. A pretest-posttest control group design was utilized in the initial experimental study; comparison group designs were used in the longitudinal studies. Three hundred seventy-four subjects completed the interventions and 12 months of research followup. We found that the intervention models had a statistically significant positive impact on arthritis knowledge, self-care behavior, perceived helplessness, and pain. These findings did not vary when the effects of education level, disease diagnosis and duration, informal social support, and treatment choice were controlled. The small group intervention was more effective in bringing about initial improvements in pain and depression, whereas the home study intervention was more effective in maintaining improvements in perceived helplessness. Changes in perceived helplessness and self-care behavior appear to explain in part the observed improvement in pain. 	01/06/1989	a	0	0		1	en	32	6	10.1002/ANR.1780320608	arthritis & rheumatism	706-716	1989	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/anr.1780320608'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anr.1780320608'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2735963'}, {'U': 'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anr.1780320608/abstract'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] rural patients	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Methods    Forty-eight workshops were randomized to the ASHC (n = 26) or CDSMP (n = 22). A total of 416 individuals, including 365 African Americans, participated. The mean age for each group was 64 years, mean years of education was 11.7, mean number of chronic conditions was 4, and 75–80% of participants in each group were female. Multivariate statistical tests were used to assess effectiveness within and between programs for all workshop participants and African Americans.        Results    At 4 months all ASHC participants including African Americans, had significant improvements (P ≤ 0.05) in self-efficacy, stretching and strengthening exercises, aerobic exercises, and general health. All CDSMP participants had statistically significant improvements in self-efficacy, disability, pain, and general health. African American CDSMP participants showed statistically significant improvements in general health. Trends toward improvement (P = 0.051–0.100) were shown in 5 variables among African American CDSMP participants and in 4 variables among all CDSMP participants. Statistically significant differences between the 2 programs at 4 months were seen in pain and disability in both groups. The CDSMP produced stronger results. Significant results at 1 year within and between programs were minimal for both groups.        Conclusion    When populations with arthritis and multiple comorbid conditions are targeted, the CDSMP may be most cost effective. 	15/08/2007	a	0	0		1	en	57	6	10.1002/ART.22896	arthritis care and research	1081-1088	2007	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/art.22896'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17665471'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.22896'}, {'U': 'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22896/full'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] African Americans	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Methods    Spanish speakers (n = 335), non-Hispanic English-speaking African Americans (n = 156), and other non-Hispanic English speakers (n = 404) were recruited separately and randomized within each of the 3 ethnic/racial categories to immediately receive the intervention Tool Kit (n = 458) or to a 4-month wait-list control status (n = 463). At the end of 4 months, controls were sent the Tool Kit. All subjects were followed in a longitudinal study for 9 months. Self-administered measures included health status, health behavior, arthritis self-efficacy, medical care utilization, and demographic variables. Using analyses of covariance and t-tests, analyses were conducted for all participants and for Spanish- and English-language groups.        Results    At 4 months, comparing all intervention subjects with randomized wait-list controls, there were significant (P < 0.01) benefits in all outcomes except medical care utilization and self-rated health. The results were maintained at 9 months compared with baseline. On average, the Tool Kit reached persons ages 50–56 years with 12–15 years of schooling. There were few differences between English- and Spanish-language participants in either the effectiveness or reach variables.        Conclusion    A mailed Arthritis Self-Management Tool Kit proved effective in improving health status, health behavior, and self-efficacy variables for up to 9 months. It also reached younger persons in both English- and Spanish-language groups and Spanish speakers with higher education levels than previous studies of the small-group Arthritis Self-Management Program. 	15/07/2009	a	0	0		1	en	61	7	10.1002/ART.24587	arthritis & rheumatism	867-875	2009	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19565554/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.24587'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19565554/'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] Spanish-speaking community	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sustainable certification has been proposed as an incentive to conserve shade grown coffee. With 40% of global coffee production certified as sustainable, evidence is needed to demonstrate whether certification supports the environmental benefits of shade coffee. Environmental and economic data were taken from 278 coffee farms in Nicaragua divided between non-certified and five different sustainable certifications. Farms were propensity-score matched by altitude, area of coffee and farmer education to ensure comparability between non-certified and certified farms. Farms under all certifications had better environmental characteristics than non-certified for some indicators, but none were better for all indicators. Certified farms generally received better prices than non-certified farms. Farms with different certifications had different investment strategies; C.A.F.E. Practice farms had high investment and high return strategies, while Utz and Organic farms had low investment, low productivity strategies. Tree diversity was inversely related to productivity, price and net revenue in general, but not for certified farms that received higher prices. Certification differentiates farms with better environmental characteristics and management, provides some economic benefits to most farmers, and may contribute to mitigating environment/economic trade-offs. 	01/08/2017	a	0	0		1	en	79		10.1016/J.ECOLIND.2017.04.023	ecological indicators	330-337	2017	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/16702'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/82894065'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X17301991'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	0	0	Education, Education	0	0	0

Although risk of injury to child passengers can be reduced by using a child restraint, most restraints are incorrectly used. This greatly reduces the restraints’ protective potential; however there is limited research on drivers of correct child restraint use. The aim of this study was to explore perceived barriers and motivators of correct child restraint use in experienced child restraint users, to inform interventions to promote correct use. Motivations and risk perceptions concerning incorrect child restraint use among high and low socioeconomic populations and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) child restraint users in Sydney, Australia were qualitatively examined. Six focus groups (N = 44 participants) were facilitated using a semi-structured discussion guide. Transcriptions were deductively analysed using QSR NVivo11 software and the COM-B model of behaviour. Common perceived barriers to correct restraint use were: (a) difficulty interpreting instructions and labels, particularly among CALD participants; (b) remembering and attending to correct use information; (c) lack of information and behavioural feedback on how to correctly install and use a child restraint; and (d) low confidence in ability to install and use a child restraint correctly. The results indicate current child restraint product information is poorly understood, particularly among those whose first language is not English. Interventions to increase correct child restraint use should address access to correct use information, capability to understand and use these, and the influence of motivation, memory and attention in the process. 	01/11/2018	a	0	0		1	en	109		10.1016/J.SSCI.2018.05.017	safety science	186-194	2018	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/128918/1/1-s2.0-S092575351731192X-main.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201802214305020698'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/128918'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/barriers-to-correct-child-restraint-use-a-qualitative-study-of-ch'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.georgeinstitute.org.au/publications/barriers-to-correct-child-restraint-use-a-qualitative-study-of-child-restraint-users'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092575351731192X'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Sydney Australia	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] culturally and linguistically diverse group included	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] 95% were female	0	Education, Education, [info] three groups of child restraint system users a participants in high income and high education brackets (high SES) b participants in lower income and lower education brackets (low SES) c participants from a culturally and linguistically diverse background	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] three groups of child restraint system users a participants in high income and high education brackets (high SES) b participants in lower income and lower education brackets (low SES) c participants from a culturally and linguistically diverse background	0	0

In Cambodia, village malaria workers (VMWs) have been providing malaria control services in remote villages to cope with the disease threats. In 2009, the VMW project integrated child health services into the original malaria control services. However, little has been studied about the utilization of VMWs’ child health services. This study aimed to identify determinants of caregivers’ VMW service utilization for childhood illness and caregivers’ knowledge of malaria management. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 36 VMW villages of Kampot and Kampong Thom provinces in July-September 2012. An equal number of VMW villages with malaria control services only (M) and those with malaria control plus child health services (M+C) were selected from each province. Using structured questionnaires, 800 caregivers of children under five and 36 VMWs, one of the two VMWs who was providing VMW services in each study village were interviewed. Results: Among the caregivers, 23% in M villages and 52% in M+C villages utilized VMW services for childhood illnesses. Determinants of caregivers’ utilization of VMWs in M villages included their VMWs’ length of experience (AOR = 11.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.46-31.19) and VMWs’ service quality (AOR = 2.04, CI = 1.01-4.11). In M+C villages, VMWs’ length of experience (AOR = 2.44, CI = 1.52-3.94) and caregivers’ wealth index (AOR = 0.35, CI = 0.18-0.68) were associated with VMW service utilization. Meanwhile, better service quality of VMWs (AOR = 3.21, CI = 1.34-7.66) and caregivers’ literacy (AOR = 9.91, CI = 4.66-21.05) were positively associated with caregivers’ knowledge of malaria management. Conclusions: VMWs’ service quality and length of experience are important determinants of caregivers’ utilization of VMWs’ child health services and their knowledge of malaria management. Caregivers are seeking VMWs’ support for childhood illnesses even if they are providing only malaria control services. This underlines the importance of scaling-up VMWs’ capacity by adding child health services of good quality, which will result in improving child health status in remote Cambodia. 	23/08/2013	a	0	0		1	en	12	1	10.1186/1475-2875-12-292	malaria journal	292-292	2013	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3765305?pdf=render'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1475-2875-12-292.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/81087185'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-12-292'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3765305'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-2875-12-292'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-12-292'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/56664111/integrating-child-health-services-into-malaria-control-services-of-village-malaria'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23968533'}, {'U': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-12-292'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ place of residence + (- those over 25 km away)	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] utilisation â€“ occupation +	0	0	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education +	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation â€“ SES +	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] utilisation â€“ age +

Since 2004, with support from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), North Korea’s Ministry of Land and Environmental Protection (MoLEP) has implemented a Sloping Land Management Program (SLMP). The SLMP established sloping land user groups and granted these groups the right to use marginal land for agroforestry development. This devolution of land rights from state control onto local groups is a landmark in North Korea, and this decentralization initiative has now expanded to over eight counties to involve thousands of households. It has also led to the launch of a National Agroforestry Policy and Strategy. Drawing from both qualitative and quantitative data collected from 2008 to 2014, this paper documents the process and effects of the SLMP. It argues that the decentralization reform in land management has contributed to not only food security with increased food crop diversity and productivity, but also notably forest recovery through an expansion of tree plantations and agroforestry practices on degraded sloping lands. However, an insufficient power transfer in the form of a lack of timber rights granted to the local user groups has hampered the effectiveness of the SLMP. There are also institutional and geopolitical challenges that are limiting further scaling-up of land-use decentralization across the country. The policy implication calls for more international investment as well as national land-use policy reforms in order to promote and facilitate further decentralization of sloping land management and to secure greater use rights for sloping land user groups. 	01/02/2017	a	0	0		1	en	61	61	10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2016.11.020	land use policy	113-125	2017	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5809704'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837716300357'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837716300357'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] temperate	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the household level impacts of a small scale agro-forestry based carbon sequestration project in rural Mozambique. In 2006, questionnaire based interviews were conducted quarterly of 290 randomly selected households in the buffer zone of the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. We used the propensity score matching technique to assess the PES-project impacts on household cash income, consumption expenditure, forest resource use and crop yields. We found that, in contrast to nonparticipant households, PES-participant households earned more cash income, incurred more consumption expenditure, collected less forest products and, harvested lower quantities of agriculture crops. In addition, we found, through decomposition analysis, that there was a differential in PES income. Both male-headed and high-income households were being favoured as project benefit recipients. Future PES-projects should focus on a payment scheme that can better ensure the benefit to all the participant households and also pay extra attention on the benefits distribution to the vulnerable households. 	15/11/2011	a	0	0		1	en	71		10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2011.08.014	ecological economics	122-130	2011	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeecolec/v_3a71_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a122-130.htm'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolec/v71y2011icp122-130.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/863222'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911003478'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

Methods (1) An effect evaluation was conducted using a randomized controlled trial with a pre-test and post-test design ( n =99) and a knowledge questionnaire. (2) A user evaluation was conducted using an online questionnaire ( n =564) and one-on-one interviews ( n =11) to examine the perceived quality, use of functionalities and use of the programme as a supportive tool in education. Results The effect evaluation showed a significant intervention effect ( p Conclusion The programme can improve knowledge, but it is not fully used as intended. A more optimal use of the programme is necessary for higher efficacy. Practice implications The use of mostly spoken text instead of written text was highly appreciated and could be used more often for educational websites. Furthermore, health care practitioners need support in implementing new educational programmes during consultations. 	01/02/2012	a	0	0		1	en	86	2	10.1016/J.PEC.2011.04.032	patient education and counseling	172-178	2012	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/82508285'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/evaluation-of-the-web-based-diabetes-interactive-education-progra'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21616626'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21616626/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2F8d272ace-0e8b-4bf5-af42-4159a05b51e4'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616626'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399111002205'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	0	0	Plus, Plus

However, enrollment of infected individuals in treatment programs continues to be hampered by the low uptake of HIV testing and counseling (HTC). Furthermore, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in sub-Saharan African countries have identified a strong socioeconomic gradient in uptake of HTC.1–4 A significant fraction of the most vulnerable households may thus be excluded from the potential benefits stemming from the knowledge of one s HIV status—such as the adoption of strategies to reduce HIV transmission to partners and children—and the benefits associated with anti-retroviral treatment—such as increased survival and labor productivity.5–8    Poor accessibility of health facilities, fatalism, HIV-related stigma and confidentiality are the main barriers to use of HTC services in African countries.9 While several strategies to increase the uptake of HTC among sub-Saharan populations have been suggested,10 their impact on the poorest may be limited. Routine testing in hospitals and other health care facilities, for example, significantly increases uptake and case-finding among the attendees of these facilities,11–13 but cost and convenience issues often limit the use of healthcare facilities among the lower socioeconomic strata in sub-Saharan countries.1,2 HTC uptake is also increased through workplace-based initiatives,14 but such strategies similarly do not reach the poorest members of society who are often unemployed or employed in the informal sector. To overcome these limitations, the home-based provision of HTC services has recently been proposed as a strategy to attain “universal HIV testing and counseling” in Africa.15 Indeed, community-based approaches—like mobile HTC units or home-based HTC provision—have been shown to dramatically increase the uptake of testing services.16–20 However, previous studies have not documented whether the provision of home-based HTC may reduce the socioeconomic gradient in HTC uptake observed in sub-Saharan countries. The objectives of this study are to measure the uptake of home-based HTC among different socioeconomic groups on Likoma, and to assess whether the home-based provision of HTC services has the potential to reduce inequalities in access to, and uptake of, HTC. 	01/06/2009	a	0	0		1	en	51	2	10.1097/QAI.0B013E31819C1726	journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes	185-193	2009	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3068048'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/increasing-uptake-of-hiv-testing-and-counseling-among-the-poorest-3'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/increasing-uptake-of-hiv-testing-and-counseling-among-the-poorest'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19352202/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093164196'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068048/'}, {'U': 'https://journals.lww.com/00126334-200906010-00012'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender -	0	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education -	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation â€“ SES +	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] utilisation â€“ age + [Relationships] utilisation â€“ marital status -

To access socio-economic conditions of both agroforestry and non agroforestry farmers, a survey was conducted in Haridwar, India. To analyze it, data pertaining to socio-economic indicators such as income level and employment, family size and community structure like land holding value, land distribution and ownership type, housing characteristics and labour resources were collected and then compared. To elaborate this comparison more, some other factors like farming and agroforestry experience, decision making, knowledge, awareness and favor to agroforestry etc. were also studied. Results revealed that approximately 97.8 per cent of sampled households were male headed. Approximately 18.90 per cent agroforestry and 34.43 per cent non-agroforestry respondents were having less than 1 ha of land. About 75.62 per cent agroforestry farmers and 67.21 per cent non agroforestry farmers considered farming as main occupation. The higher income status in categories was found more (12.60% and 27.40%) in agroforestry respondents than (6.56% and 14.75%) in non agroforestry respondents. It was concluded that higher income status enables agroforestry farmers to live their live style according to their own choice, hence, encouraging them to adopt, continue or promote agroforestry in their field. 	01/02/2017	a	0	0		1	en	12	1	10.15740/HAS/AU/12.1/1-8	agriculture update	01-Aug	2017	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.i-scholar.in/index.php/Au/article/view/141583'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] sub-tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

This paper, based on data from Bangladesh, presents an illustrative analysis of how an outreach programme can be evaluated by this criterion. A scale for perceived service quality is developed from five indicators of desirable characteristics of services. Regression methods are used to assess the impact of outreach service encounters on the perceived quality scale. Econometric methods are used to adjust for endogeneity that arises from the selectivity of outreach encounters and the selective service exposure of contraceptive users. Results show that increasing contact with outreach workers increases client satisfaction with the overall quality of the Bangladesh family planning programme. 	01/09/2004	a	0	0		1	en	36	5	10.1017/S0021932003006370	journal of biosocial science	507-522	2004	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://philpapers.org/rec/HOSTEO-4'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/effects-of-outreach-on-perceived-quality-of-care-in-two-rural-areas-of-bangladesh/F21A268D54B85F6AED10BC41D172188A'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446349'}, {'U': 'http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0021932003006370'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] access â€“ place of residence â€“ quality-	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Disease-specific interventions have been implemented to aid specific ACD groups through transition. A generic approach might be effective and cost-saving. METHODS: Eighty-one ACD, aged 12 to 20 years, were recruited for a randomized clinical trial evaluating an 8-month transition intervention (MD2Me). MD2Me recipients received a 2-month intensive Web-based and text-delivered disease management and skill-based intervention followed by a 6-month review period. MD2Me recipients also had access to a texting algorithm for disease assessment and health care team contact. The intervention was applicable to adolescents with diverse chronic illnesses. Controls received mailed materials on general health topics. Disease management, health-related self-efficacy, and health assessments were performed at baseline and at 2 and 8 months. Frequency of patient-initiated communications was recorded over the study period. Outcomes were analyzed according to assigned treatment group over time. RESULTS: MD2Me recipients demonstrated significant improvements in performance of disease management tasks, health-related self-efficacy, and patient-initiated communications compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in ACD improved significantly among recipients of a generic, technology-based intervention. Technology can deliver transition interventions to adolescents with diverse chronic illnesses, and a generic approach offers a cost-effective means of positively influencing transition outcomes. Further research is needed to determine whether improved short-term outcomes translate into an improved transition for ACD. 	01/06/2014	a	0	0		1	en	133	6	10.1542/PEDS.2013-2830	pediatrics		2014	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4035589'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843066'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/133/6/e1639'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24843066/'}, {'U': 'https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/lookup/doi/10.1542/peds.2013-2830'}, {'U': 'https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/133/6/e1639.full.pdf'}]		0	0	0	0	0	Education, Education	0	0	0

We conducted a survey and three focus groups with parents of children aged 3-5 years enrolled at three early learning centres on the Australian south-east coast. Survey data were triangulated with qualitative data from focus groups and analysed using the PRECEDE-PROCEED conceptual framework. Of the 133 eligible families, 97 (73%) parents completed the survey including 31% of parents who reported their children were Aboriginal. Use of age-appropriate car seats was reported by 80 (83%) of the participants, and awareness of the child car seat legislation was high (91/97, 94%). Children aged 2-3 years were less likely reported to be restrained in an age-appropriate car seat than were older children aged 4-5 years (60% versus 95%: χ² = 19.14, p < 0.001). Focus group participants highlighted how important their child s safety was to them, spoke of the influence grandparents had on their use of child car seats and voiced mixed views on the value of authorised child car seat fitters. Future programs should include access to affordable car seats and target community members as well as parents with clear, consistent messages highlighting the safety benefits of using age-appropriate car seats. 	10/10/2017	a	0	0		1	en	14	10	10.3390/IJERPH14101206	international journal of environmental research and public health	1206	2017	[{'Ty': 999, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/154312010'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1884&context=ahsri'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5664707'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://doaj.org/article/799f8ca92c1c420eaf879110d04ab5df'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28994725/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ro.uow.edu.au/ahsri/874/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.georgeinstitute.org/publications/hes-the-number-one-thing-in-my-world-application-of-the-precede-proceed-model-to'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664707'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] New South Wales Australia	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] Aboriginal but spoke English as their primary language at home	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] all were female	0	Education, Education, [info] from different educational strata almost equally	0	0	0

We conducted 30-min telephone surveys with 983 persons with MS nationwide, 21-64 years old, to explore how financial and health insurance concerns affect access to services including MS drugs. Almost everyone (96.3%) had some health insurance. Multivariable logistic regression analyses accounted for demographic, disease and insurance characteristics. Only 10.8% of those <40 years old had never received disease-modifying medications, compared with 41.1% of persons aged 60-64. Among the uninsured, 36.8% reported having never taken these medications, compared with 21.2% of persons with health insurance. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of using these drugs in prior 12 months among the uninsured (compared with insured persons) was 0.28 (0.08, 0.95). Just over 16% of persons with public health plans reported that their insurer initially denied coverage for MS medication. When asked about MS medications in general, 22.3% reported having not filled prescriptions, skipping doses or splitting pills because of cost concerns; 22.4% worried ;a lot  about getting MS medications when they needed them. Substantial fractions of persons with MS confront financial and health plan-related barriers to obtaining MS drugs. 	01/01/2008	a	0	0		1	en	14	1	10.1177/1352458507080466	multiple sclerosis journal	112-122	2008	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/17893109'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1352458507080466'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17893109/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17893109'}, {'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1352458507080466'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (white black other)	Occupation, Occupation, [info] occupation (employed or not employed)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (high school or less some college college degree postgrad education)	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (measured by poverty zip codes)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age MS subtype [Relationships] social support (marital status)

However, little is known about mobility aid use by persons with MS living in the community. Objectives To explore perceptions of mobility problems related to MS and patterns of mobility aid use by persons with MS residing in communities across the United States. Methods We conducted a 30-minute telephone survey in mid-2007 with 703 community-dwelling, working-age adults who self-reported having MS. We identified potential survey respondents using membership lists of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, oversampling individuals living in zip codes with relatively high poverty rates. All analyses, including calculation of simple percentages, used sampling weights to produce population estimates. The overall response rate was 73.4%. Survey questions asked basic information about all mobility aids used by respondents and details about up to two different aids. We used multivariable polychotomous logistic regression to predict use of various mobility aids accounting for demographic and disease characteristics. Results In questions about the previous 2 weeks, needing to concentrate on walking because of MS was the most common problem cited (weighted percent = 79.3%), followed by MS making standing more difficult (69.9%), increased effort needed to walk (59.0%), and needing to hold onto furniture, walls, or someone s arm when walking indoors every day (40.0%). Among the 703 respondents, 434 (weighted percent = 60.5%) reported using at least one mobility aid; the majority of these individuals reported using more than one type of aid. Manual wheelchairs were the most common mobility aid (63.4%), followed by canes (56.7%), power wheelchairs (36.7%), and scooters (32.2%). Among those using three or more different types of mobility aids, the large majority used manual wheelchairs (88.2%), followed by canes (65.4%). Persons who are married or living with partners were much less likely to use powered equipment than those who were never married (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13–0.82). Women were much less likely than men to use powered equipment (AOR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.21–0.75). Conclusion The vast majority of persons with MS who use at least one mobility aid own more than one type and about half own three or more different types of mobility aids. Persons with MS appear to “mix and match” different devices to suit their specific mobility needs. Given restrictive health insurance coverage policies for mobility aids, these findings raise questions about how persons acquire and pay for higher-technology mobility aids. 	01/04/2009	a	0	0		1	en	2	2	10.1016/J.DHJO.2008.12.001	disability and health journal	67-76	2009	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21122745/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21122745'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936657408001817'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1936657408001817'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (white black Hispanic other)	Occupation, Occupation, [info] occupation (employment status)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (high school college degree postgrad)	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (high poverty zip codes)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age MS subtype [Relationships] social support (marital status)

Cellular and short range communication technologies will be important for the routine usage of these systems. However, the issues of follow-up and patient compliance with these emerging systems have not been yet studied evaluated but could be critical to the adoption of these technologies. We evaluated the impact of mobile telemonitoring on the intensification of care on blood pressure control and exposure to hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes. We randomised 137 patients with diabetes to either mobile telemonitoring (n = 3D72) or usual care patients (n = 3D65) for 9 months. In this paper we present some of the clinical results with focus on blood pressure control hypertension and highlight some of the technical and compliance issues that were encountered. 	13/11/2009	p	0	0		1	en	2009		10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334580		5130-5133	2009	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19965037'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005334580'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5334580/'}, {'U': 'http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5334580/'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Hematuria continues to be an important sign of urologic disease, including urothelial malignancy. An increasing awareness of gender differences in tumor stage at bladder cancer presentation has led to speculation about delayed referral and diagnosis in women. However, little is known about the referral patterns of hematuria and whether gender differences exist. Methods The insurance records were examined from 926 consecutive adult health plan participants (559 men and 367 women) with newly diagnosed hematuria from 1998 to 2002. The patterns of urologic referral were evaluated. A Cox multivariate regression model was used to examine the relationship between urologic referral and the relevant variables. Results Overall, 263 men (47%) and 102 women (28%) were referred for urologic evaluation of hematuria, with a median follow-up of 27 and 26 months, respectively. Referral was initiated by the primary care physician in 80% of the cohort. Increased urologic referral was associated with advancing age, repeated hematuria, provider type, and male gender. The adjusted hazard ratio of male referral was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.31-2.08) compared with female referral. Conclusions Primary care physicians practicing in a managed care setting are less likely to refer women for a urologic evaluation of new or first recurrent episodes of hematuria than to refer men in all patient age categories, except for 40-49 years. This apparent gender disparity could result in unequal access of specialty evaluation and could potentially delay the diagnosis of important urologic conditions. 	01/09/2008	a	0	0		1	en	72	3	10.1016/J.UROLOGY.2008.01.086	urology	498-502	2008	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/18619657'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18619657/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18619657'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/patterns-of-hematuria-referral-to-urologists-does-a-gender-dispar'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429508004913'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (Caucasian Native American Asian African American)	Occupation, Occupation, [info] occupation (employment status)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (high school vocational college degree professional graduate)	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability severity (EDSS) MS subtype [Relationships] social support (marital status)

They designed a booster seat promotion campaign using an integrated social cognition model of health behavior. A series of focus groups were held with low-income African American, Somali, and Vietnamese parents to understand determinants of booster seat use in these communities. Deficits in understanding about the purpose of booster seats were seen in all groups, and concerns about cost and self-efficacy varied in important ways. Although legislation is an important tool in motivating child passenger restraint, most families saw safety as the prime reason to use booster seats with their children. These results illustrate the use of qualitative data to adapt a theory-based intervention to the needs of specific communities. 	01/07/2009	a	0	0		1	en	10	3	10.1177/1524839908317743	health promotion practice	411-418	2009	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1524839908317743'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://hpp.sagepub.com/content/10/3/411.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1524839908317743'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://trid.trb.org/view/899847'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093207739'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18540004'}, {'U': 'http://hpp.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/1524839908317743'}, {'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1524839908317743'}, {'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20093207739.html'}, {'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524839908317743'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] central and southeast Seattle USA	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] only African American Somali and Vietnamese parents were recruited	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] 80% female overall disaggregated by race reported	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] low-income groups were specifically recruited for the study 63% own a vehicle (disaggregated by race reported)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] are likely to be immigrants

SMPP is a Japanese aid-funded technical cooperation project aimed at developing local capacities to tackle maternal and newborn health problems in rural areas. We assessed whether the project interventions, in particular, community-based activities under the Model Union approach, had a favorable impact on women s access to and knowledge of maternal health care during pregnancy and childbirth. The project comprises a package of interlinked interventions to facilitate safe motherhood practices at primary and secondary care levels. The primary-level activities focused on community mobilization through participatory approaches. The secondary-level activities aimed at strengthening organizational and personnel capacities for delivering emergency obstetric care (EmOC) at district and sub-district level hospitals. The project impact was estimated by difference-in-differences logistic regressions using two rounds of cross-sectional household survey data. The results showed that the project successfully increased the utilization of antenatal visits and postpartum EmOC services and also enhanced women s knowledge of danger signs during pregnancy and delivery. The project also reduced income inequalities in access to antenatal care. In contrast, we found no significant increase in the use of skilled birth attendants (SBA) in the project site. Nonetheless, community mobilization activities and the government s voucher scheme played a complementary role in promoting the use of SBA. 	01/04/2013	a	0	0		1	en	83		10.1016/J.SOCSCIMED.2013.01.035	social science & medicine	34-41	2013	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465202'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:socmed:v:83:y:2013:i:c:p:34-41'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v83y2013icp34-41.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613000622'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613000622'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation - SES + (non CHW-)	0	0

Severe acute malnutrition affects fewer children but is associated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity. Supplementary feeding programs aim to treat moderate acute malnutrition and prevent the deterioration to severe acute malnutrition.Objective: The aim was to compare recovery rates of children with moderate acute malnutrition in supplementary feeding programs by using the newly recommended ration of ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) and the more conventional ration of corn-soya blend (CSB) in Ethiopia.Design: A total of 1125 children aged 6–60 mo with moderate acute malnutrition received 16 wk of CSB or RUSF. Children were randomly assigned to receive one or the other food. The daily rations were purposely based on the conventional treatment rations distributed at the time of the study in Ethiopia: 300 g CSB and 32 g vegetable oil in the control group (1413 kcal) and 92 g RUSF in the intervention group (500 kcal). The higher ration size of CSB was provided because of expected food sharing.Results: The HR for children in the CSB group was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.99), which indicated that they had 15% lower recovery (P = 0.039). Recovery rates of children at the end of the 16-wk treatment period trended higher in the RUSF group (73%) than in the CSB group (67%) (P = 0.056).Conclusion: In comparison with CSB, the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition with RUSF resulted in higher recovery rates in children, despite the large ration size and higher energy content of the conventional CSB ration.

This study assessed how challenges could be minimised and performance improved using existing traditional kinship structures. In classic CDTI areas, community members decide upon selection criteria for community distributors, centers for health education and training, and methods of distributing ivermectin. In kinship enhanced CDTI, similar procedures were followed at the kinship level. We compared 14 randomly selected kinship enhanced CDTI communities with 25 classic CDTI communities through interviews of 447 and 750 household members and 127 and 64 community distributors respectively. Household respondents from kinship enhanced CDTI reported better performance (P<0.001) than classic CDTI on the following measures of program effectiveness: (a) treatment coverage (b) decision on treatment location and (c) mobilization for CDTI activities. There were more female distributors in kinship enhanced CDTI than in classic CDTI. Attrition was not a problem. Kinship enhanced CDTI had a higher number of community distributors per population working among relatives, and were more likely to be involved in additional health care activities. The results suggest that kinship enhanced CDTI was more effective than classic CDTI. 	01/04/2010	a	0	0		1	en	104	4	10.1016/J.TRSTMH.2009.10.012	transactions of the royal society of tropical medicine and hygiene	265-272	2010	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/river_blindness/traditional-kinship-system-TRSTMH-jan2010.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20106493'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20106493'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article/104/4/265/1891943'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103113345'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.rti.org/publication/traditional-kinship-system-enhanced-classic-community-directed-treatment-invermectin'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0035920309003538'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035920309003538'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Social capital, Social capital, [info] access â€“ social capital - quality â€“ social capital â€“ empowerment â€“ social capital +	0

The impacts are felt more in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where poverty levels are very high. Malawi just like all other countries in SSA is experiencing serious problems of HIV and AIDS as well as high levels of poverty. In responding to the impacts of HIV and AIDS and poverty, there are a number of agricultural based responses that are being promoted ranging from technological adaptation to agroforestry systems. Kasungu Chipala and Chulu Extension Planning Areas have benefited from International Centre for Research in Agroforestry’s (ICRAF) agroforestry scaling up programs in the past fifteen years. The specific objective of the study was to assess whether agroforestry contributed to increases in maize yields of HIV and AIDS affected households. Data was collected using household survey questionnaires, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The results showed that households practicing agroforestry were obtaining higher maize yields as compared to households that were not practicing agroforestry. The study concludes that households affected by HIV and AIDS need to practice agroforestry for achievement of food security. The recommendation is that there is need for more scaling up of agroforestry technologies in the face of exorbitant prices for inorganic fertilizers. 	20/12/2013	a	0	0		1	en	1	1		the journal of agricultural extension	01-Jul	2013	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://escijournals.net/index.php/IJAE/article/view/430/0'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20143145883'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] sub-tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

A better understanding of the factors associated with CHW utilization is crucial in informing national malaria control policy and strategy in Kenya. Specifically, little is known in Kenya on the extent to which CHWs are utilized, the characteristics of families who report utilizing CHWs and whether utilization is associated with improved access to prompt and effective malaria treatment. This paper examines factors associated with utilization of CHWs in improving access to malaria treatment among children under five years of age by women caregivers in two malaria endemic districts in Kenya. 	30/07/2012	a	0	0		1	en	11	1	10.1186/1475-2875-11-248	malaria journal	248-248	2012	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1475-2875-11-S1-P142.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/14683?show=full'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-11-248.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3473249'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1475-2875-11-248'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-11-248'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/56658178/factors-associated-with-utilization-of-community-health-workers-in-improving-access-to'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494507/'}, {'U': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emmanuel_Wamalwa/publication/230587919_Factors_associated_with_utilization_of_community_health_workers_in_improving_access_to_malaria_treament_among_children_in_Kenya/links/00463526f59c981b71000000.pdf'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1475-2875-11-248/fulltext.html'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ household size +	0	0	0	0	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education +	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation â€“ SES +	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] utilisation â€“ age + [Relationships] utilisation â€“ village size -

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the ADolescent Adherence Patient Tool (ADAPT), an interactive mobile health (mHealth) intervention, in supporting self-management and improving inhaled corticosteroid adherence in adolescents with asthma. Methods We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in 66 Dutch community pharmacies. Asthma patients aged 12–18 years were invited to participate, based on pharmacy medication refill records. The main study outcome was self-reported medication adherence, measured with the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS). Secondary outcomes were asthma control and quality of life. Outcomes were measured at start (t = 0 months) and at the end of follow-up (t = 6 months). Mixed-effects models were used to analyze the effect. Results In total, 234 adolescents (147 in the control group and 87 in the intervention group) completed the study; mean age 15.1 ± 1.9 years and 52.6% females. Adherence rates of patients with low baseline adherence (MARS scores ≤19; n = 76) increased with 1.42 points in the intervention group (n = 26). Adherence rates of patients in the control group (n = 50) decreased with 0.70 points. Thus there was a positive effect of the intervention on medication adherence (MARS +2.12, p = 0.04). This effect was stronger (MARS +2.52, p = 0.02) in poor adherent adolescents with uncontrolled asthma (n = 74). No effect of the intervention was observed on asthma control or quality of life. Conclusions The ADAPT intervention increases medication adherence in adolescents with asthma having poor adherence rates at baseline. Healthcare providers should consider a tailored mHealth approach to improve the asthma treatment. 	01/03/2019	a	0	0		1	en	149		10.1016/J.RMED.2019.02.009	respiratory medicine	45-51	2019	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30803885/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30803885'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611119300459'}, {'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0954611119300459'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus

However, recovery rates remain ,75%, lower than the rate achieved with peanut paste‐based ready-to-use supplementary foods (RUSFs). To bridge this gap, a novel CSB recipe fortified with oil and dry skim milk, “CSB++,” has been developed. Objective: In this trial we compared CSB++ with 2 RUSF products for the treatment of MAM to test the hypothesis that the recovery rate achieved with CSB++ will not be .5% worse than that achieved with either RUSF. Design: We conducted a prospective, randomized, investigatorblinded, controlled noninferiority trial involving rural Malawian children aged 6‐59 mo with MAM. Children received 75 kcal CSB++ kg 21 d 21 , locally produced soy RUSF, or an imported soy/whey RUSF for 12 wk. Results: The recovery rate for CSB++ (n = 763 of 888; 85.9%) was similar to that for soy RUSF (795 of 806, 87.7%; risk difference: 21.82%; 95% CI: 24.95%, 1.30%) and soy/whey RUSF (807 of 918, 87.9%; risk difference: 21.99%; 95% CI: 25.10%, 1.13%). On average, children who received CSB++ required 2 d longer to recover, and the rate of weight gain was less than that with either RUSF, although height gain was the same among all 3 foods studied. Conclusions: A novel, locally produced, fortified blendedflour (CSB++) was not inferior to a locally produced soy RUSF and an imported soy/whey RUSF in facilitating recovery from MAM. The recovery rate observed for CSB++ was higher than that for any other fortified blended flour tested previously. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00998517.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in nine women’s shelters across the Netherlands. 136 women were assigned to CTI (n = 70) or care-as-usual (n = 66). Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat three-level mixed-effects models. Women in the CTI group had significant fewer symptoms of post-traumatic stress (secondary outcome) (adjusted mean difference − 7.27, 95% CI − 14.31 to − 0.22) and a significant fourfold reduction in unmet care needs (intermediate outcome) (95% CI 0.06–0.94) compared to women in the care-as-usual group. No differences were found for quality of life (primary outcome), re-abuse, symptoms of depression, psychological distress, self-esteem (secondary outcomes), family support, and social support (intermediate outcomes). This study shows that CTI is effective in a population of abused women in terms of a reduction of post-traumatic stress symptoms and unmet care needs. Because follow-up ended after the prescribed intervention period, further research is needed to determine the full long-term effects of CTI in this population. 	03/01/2018	a	0	0		1	en	63	4	10.1007/S00038-017-1067-1	international journal of public health	513-523	2018	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1550&context=hc_pubs'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00038-017-1067-1.pdf'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://pure.hva.nl/ws/files/4099616/Lako_et_al._2018_.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/191567'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academicworks.cuny.edu/hc_pubs/571/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/158610815'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:ijphth:v:63:y:2018:i:4:d:10.1007_s00038-017-1067-1'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29299613'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/ijphth/v63y2018i4d10.1007_s00038-017-1067-1.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00038-017-1067-1'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29299613/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://research.hva.nl/en/publications/the-effectiveness-of-critical-time-intervention-for-abused-women-'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29299613'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-017-1067-1/fulltext.html'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] shelter	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] the proportion of Dutch-speaking women with unmet care needs declined from 88% to 57% while the proportion of non-Dutch-speaking women with unmet care needs declined from 100% to 90%	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] women	0	Education, Education, [info] low intermediate high	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] unmet care needs

Objective: The aim was to explore demographic and clinical moderators of the effect of an internet-delivered intervention on changes in pain and physical function in people with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Exploratory analysis of data from 148 people with knee osteoarthritis who participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing internet-delivered exercise, education, and pain coping skills training to internet-delivered education alone. Primary outcomes were changes in knee pain while walking (11-point Numerical Rating Scale) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index function subscale) at 3 and 9 months. Separate regression models were fit with moderator variables (age, gender, expectations of outcomes, self-efficacy [pain], education, employment status, pain catastrophizing, body mass index) and study group as covariates, including an interaction between the two. Results: Participants in the intervention group who were currently employed had significantly greater reductions in pain at 3 months than similar participants in the control group (between-group difference: mean 2.38, 95% CI 1.52-3.23 Numerical Rating Scale units; interaction P=.02). Additionally, within the intervention group, pain at 3 months reduced by mean 0.53 (95% CI 0.28-0.78) Numerical Rating Scale units per unit increase in baseline self-efficacy for managing pain compared to mean 0.11 Numerical Rating Scale units (95% CI –0.13 to 0.35; interaction P=.02) for the control group. Conclusions: People who were employed and had higher self-efficacy at baseline were more likely to experience greater improvements in pain at 3 months after an internet-delivered exercise, education, and pain coping skills training program. There was no evidence of a difference in the effect across gender, educational level, expectation of treatment outcome, or across age, body mass index, or tendency to catastrophize pain. Findings support the effectiveness of internet-delivered care for a wide range of people with knee osteoarthritis, but future confirmatory research is needed.

This study investigates Latino parents’ knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about booster seats, barriers to booster seat use, and effective strategies for message delivery in the Latino community. Methods: Two focus groups were conducted with Spanish speaking parents. Information was obtained through a written survey and moderated discussions. Results: Parents were widely misinformed about recommended guidelines for booster seat use, and the majority of participants did not own a booster seat. Parents identified a lack of information, the cost of booster seats, resistance to use by the child or the father, limited space in the vehicle, and unavailability of shoulder belts as barriers to booster seat use. Participants felt that learning more about the new Washington state booster seat law and its consequences would increase booster seat use. Public health messages felt to be effective were those in Spanish, delivered by credible spokespeople such as physicians and teachers, and utilizing the Spanish media. Conclusions: Campaigns to promote booster seats in the Latino community should be culturally specific, and clear guidelines for booster seat use should be given in Spanish. Legislation may be an important incentive for using booster seats, though reducing their cost and providing strategies to address child resistance and physical constraints of some vehicles are also important. 	01/09/2003	a	0	0		1	en	9	3	10.1136/IP.9.3.268	injury prevention	268-269	2003	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/injuryprev/9/3/268.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1730998'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/9/3/268'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12966019'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_1706_19'}, {'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/9/3/268.full.pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Seattle USA	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] Spanish speaking	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] all but two were female	0	0	0	0	0

As road trauma is a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality in highly motorised nations, even in countries where restraint use is high, encouraging parents to place children in the rear seats of vehicles offers a low-cost avenue to improving children’s overall health. However, little is known about the factors that affect parents’ decisions about seating positions. Objective: To explore parental perceptions of barriers to placing their children in the rear seat of passenger vehicles whenever possible. Design and subjects: Focus group discussions were held with urban parent-drivers to elicit their concerns about children’s car safety and barriers to rear-seat use. Results: Most parents had a rule that children should sit in the rear seat. Parents said that they relaxed these rules for a variety of reasons including social pressure, perceptions of the trip as short and because children regard sitting in the front seat as a treat. Parenting style, child cooperativeness, social pressure and inability to justify the risk of injury were identified as barriers to rear-seat travel. Conclusions: Effective interventions to increase the proportion of children travelling in the rear seat should address parents’ experiences of pressure to relax seating rules and risk perception, as well as provide strategies that support sound parental safety decisions. 	01/04/2007	a	0	0		1	en	13	2	10.1136/IP.2006.012906	injury prevention	105-109	2007	[{'Ty': 999, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/146907958'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/injuryprev/13/2/105.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2610574'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://eprints.qut.edu.au/7321/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/13/2/105'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://trid.trb.org/view/809149'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2610574/'}, {'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/13/2/105.full.pdf'}, {'U': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexia_Lennon/publication/6383061_A_risky_treat_exploring_parental_perceptions_of_the_barriers_to_seating_their_children_in_the_rear_seats_of_passenger_vehicles/links/00b495349bbf6b3755000000.pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Brisbane Australia	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] most were Caucasian	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] 21 mothers and 3 fathers	0	Education, Education, [info] most parents had at least some postsecondary education (20/24)	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] centres for recruitment were selected based on SES indicators of the surrounding suburbs (one in an upper SES area one drawing on lower SES suburbs) around half (13/24) of the parents indicating family income $A60 000 per annum (consistent with national figures for median income for couple-families with children)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] most parents were aged between 30 and 39 years (16/24) [Relationships] two step families and at least two sole-parent families

However, data on the effects of mobile health technology on patient outcomes in resource-limited settings are limited. We aimed to assess whether mobile phone communication between health-care workers and patients starting antiretroviral therapy in Kenya improved drug adherence and suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA load. Methods WelTel Kenya1 was a multisite randomised clinical trial of HIV-infected adults initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in three clinics in Kenya. Patients were randomised (1:1) by simple randomisation with a random number generating program to a mobile phone short message service (SMS) intervention or standard care. Patients in the intervention group received weekly SMS messages from a clinic nurse and were required to respond within 48 h. Randomisation, laboratory assays, and analyses were done by investigators masked to treatment allocation; however, study participants and clinic staff were not masked to treatment. Primary outcomes were self-reported ART adherence (>95% of prescribed doses in the past 30 days at both 6 and 12 month follow-up visits) and plasma HIV-1 viral RNA load suppression ( Findings Between May, 2007, and October, 2008, we randomly assigned 538 participants to the SMS intervention (n=273) or to standard care (n=265). Adherence to ART was reported in 168 of 273 patients receiving the SMS intervention compared with 132 of 265 in the control group (relative risk [RR] for non-adherence 0·81, 95% CI 0·69–0·94; p=0·006). Suppressed viral loads were reported in 156 of 273 patients in the SMS group and 128 of 265 in the control group, (RR for virologic failure 0·84, 95% CI 0·71–0·99; p=0·04). The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve greater than 95% adherence was nine (95% CI 5·0–29·5) and the NNT to achieve viral load suppression was 11 (5·8–227·3). Interpretation Patients who received SMS support had significantly improved ART adherence and rates of viral suppression compared with the control individuals. Mobile phones might be effective tools to improve patient outcome in resource-limited settings.

Children living in the poorest households are particularly disadvantaged. Community case management (CCM) uses trained and supervised community health workers to improve access to, quality of and demand for effective case management. Evidence that CCM programs can achieve equitable improvements in coverage is limited. This cross-sectional study uses a quasi-experimental design with intervention and comparison areas. Outcomes of a CCM program for malaria and diarrhoea operating in two districts of Cameroon were measured after 1 year of implementation. A household census (N = 16 954) provided measurement of treatment-seeking behaviour for recent episodes of fever and diarrhoea. Results were compared between areas using chi-square tests. Intervention-area children with fever or diarrhoea were nearly nine times more likely to receive treatment with artemisinin combination therapy or oral rehydration salts, respectively, vs neighbouring comparison-area children. High levels of effective treatment were equitable across socioeconomic status in intervention areas, whereas disparities were observed in neighbouring comparison areas. CCM can achieve rapid and equitable improvements in coverage of case management for malaria and diarrhoea, and is a promising strategy for achieving MDG 4.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interview were conducted in the maternity departments of two hospitals in China. Parents of newborns were recruited after delivery and surveyed on their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding child safety seats use. Pregnant women were also interviewed to learn about their views and decisions regarding child safety seats use. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data collected. RESULTS: Of a total of 242 parents of newborns recruited in the quantitative survey, 202 (83.5%) parents had heard of child safety seats and 149 (61.6%) parents reported they would use child safety seats for their babies. Parents  knowledge, car ownership, occupation, and income were significantly associated with their decision regarding use of child safety seats. Three themes were identified from the qualitative interview of 30 pregnant women: (1) the pregnant women perceived child passenger safety as important; (2) the car ownership and price and quality of child safety seats were major influencing factors of their decisions on use of child safety seats; and (3) lack of awareness and lack of laws requiring use were perceived to contribute to low use of child safety seats in China. CONCLUSION: Lack of knowledge and awareness on child passenger safety were found to be two most important factors associated with low use of child safety seats. Effective interventions are urgently needed to improve parents  knowledge before laws are enacted and implemented.

METHODS Three hundred and thirty one subjects were randomized to the program or to a 4-month wait list control group. One hundred ninety eight subjects continued in a 1-year longitudinal study. Data were collected via mailed questionnaires with telephone follow up. RESULTS At 4 months, treatment subjects, compared with controls, demonstrated positive changes in exercise, disability, pain, and self-efficacy (P < 0.05). At 1 year, compared with baseline, treatment subjects demonstrated improvements in exercise, general health, disability, pain, self-efficacy, and depression (P < 0.05). Baseline and 4-month changes in self-efficacy predicted health status at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS Spanish-speaking participants of an arthritis self-management program demonstrate short- and long-term benefits (improved health behaviors, health status, and self-efficacy). 	01/09/1999	a	0	0		1	en	37	9	10.1097/00005650-199909000-00011	medical care	957-963	1999	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/10493473'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10493473/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10493473'}, {'U': 'https://insights.ovid.com/medical-care/mcar/1999/09/000/community-based-spanish-language-arthritis/11/00005650'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] Spanish-speaking community	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We hypothesized that people with type 2 diabetes in an on-line diabetes self-management program, compared to usual-care controls, would demonstrate 1) reduced A1c at 6 and 18 months, 2) have fewer symptoms, 3) increased exercise and 4) improved self-efficacy and patient activation. In addition, participants randomized to listserve reinforcement would have better 18-month outcomes than participants receiving no reinforcement. Research Design and Methods. 761 participants were randomized to 1) the program, 2) program with email reinforcement, or 3) usual-care controls (no treatment). This sample included 110 American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Analyses of covariance models were used at 6 and 18-month follow-up to compare groups. Results. At six months A1c, patient activation and self efficacy were improved for program participants compared to usual care controls (p Conclusions. An on-line diabetes self-management program is acceptable for people with type 2 diabetes. Although the results were mixed they suggest 1) that the program may have beneficial effects in reducing A1c, 2) AI/AN populations can be engaged in and benefit from on-line interventions, and 3) our follow-up reinforcement appeared to have no value. 	17/03/2010	a	0	0		1	en	33	6	10.2337/DC09-2153	diabetes care	1275-1281	2010	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/diacare/33/6/1275.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/article/MED/20299481'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/6/1275'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/43067427/online-diabetes-self-management-program-a-randomized-study'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20299481/'}, {'U': 'http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.2337/dc09-2153'}, {'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20299481'}, {'U': 'https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2010/03/10/dc09-2153.figures-only'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The bladder/bowel subscale (PSB) of PS has not been validated. It is also unknown whether ethnic or socioeconomic disparities exist in bladder care. Objective We aimed to validate the bladder/bowel subscale used by the NARCOMS registry and to describe urologic symptoms, investigations, and treatments received by registry participants. Methods In the Fall 2005 update questionnaire, we collected the Bowel Control Scale (BWCS) and Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6) as criterion measures and urologic investigations and treatments. We measured associations between investigations, treatments, and symptoms with clinical and sociodemographic variables using chi(2) tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, followed by multivariable logistic regression. Results Nine thousand six hundred eighty-eight participants completed the survey. For the UDI-6, the median (interquartile range) score was 33.3 (16.7 to 50.0), for the BWCS 3 (1 to 6), and for the PSB 1 (1 to 3). The correlation between the PSB and the UDI-6 was r = 0.67 and between the PSB and the BWCS r = 0.53 (both p Conclusion The Performance Scales bladder question has adequate criterion and construct validity in multiple sclerosis (MS). There are ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in bladder management in MS. 	05/06/2007	a	0	0		1	en	68	23	10.1212/01.WNL.0000264416.53077.8B	neurology	1971-1978	2007	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://n.neurology.org/content/68/23/1971'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17548546/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17548546'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.neurology.org/cgi/doi/10.1212/01.wnl.0000264416.53077.8b'}, {'U': 'http://n.neurology.org/content/68/23/1971'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (not detailed)	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (not detailed)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] disability severity (PDSS)

Among MS patients we examined the association between ICU admission and health care utilization in the year preceding admission, and compared health care utilization following ICU admission among persons with MS and persons from the general population. Methods We used population-based administrative data from Manitoba, Canada to identify 4237 MS cases of which 2547 were incident. We compared the incidence rates of ICU admission in the prevalent MS population according to health care utilization in the year before admission, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity and socioeconomic status. Among incident cases of MS we compared rates of health care utilization after ICU admission to those in a matched general population cohort. We used generalized linear models adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, region, comorbidity and utilization before admission. Results Of 4219 prevalent MS cases, 222 (5.3%) were admitted to the ICU. After adjustment, any hospitalization in the prior year conferred an 80% increased incidence, and physician visits in the highest tertile and prescription costs in the highest quartile in the prior year each conferred a more than two-fold increased incidence of admission. Among 2547 incident cases of MS, 109 (4.3%) were admitted to the ICU and 93 survived their admission. Thirty-eight percent of the MS population were re-hospitalized in the year following admission, similar to the matched population (33.8%). Seven percent of both populations were readmitted to the ICU. The MS population had more hospital days after ICU admission than the matched population (adjusted RR 3.11; 95% CI: 1.34–5.90). After adjustment the number of physician visits did not differ between populations. Conclusions The incidence of ICU admission is higher among persons with MS who have higher prior health care utilization. Health care utilization remains high after ICU admission. Efforts to prevent ICU admission in this population are needed. 	01/07/2015	a	0	0		1	en	4	4	10.1016/J.MSARD.2015.05.010	multiple sclerosis and related disorders	296-303	2015	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26195046'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26195046/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26195046'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034815000711'}, {'U': 'https://www.msard-journal.com/article/S2211034815000711/pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (urban rural)	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (household income quintiles)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] Age

These children are typically given fortified corn/soy blended flour (CSB), but this intervention has shown limited effectiveness. Fortified spreads (FS) can be used as supplementary foods instead; they are energy-dense, lipid-based pastes with added powdered micronutrients. In this randomized clinical effectiveness trial, the recovery rates were compared among children with moderate wasting who received either milk/peanut FS, soy/peanut FS, or CSB. Children received isoenergetic quantities of food, 314 kJ x kg(-1) x d(-1), for up to 8 wk with biweekly follow-up. The primary outcome was recovery, defined as having a WHZ > -2. Time-event analysis was used to compare the recovery rate. A total of 1362 children were enrolled in the study. Children receiving soy/peanut FS had a similar recovery rate to those receiving milk/peanut FS and children in either FS group were more likely to recover than those receiving CSB (80% in both FS groups vs. 72% in the CSB group; P < 0.01). The rate of weight gain in the first 2 wk was greater among children receiving milk/peanut FS (2.6 g x kg(-1) x d(-1), n = 465) or children receiving soy/peanut FS (2.4 g x kg(-1) x d(-1), n = 450) than among children receiving CSB (2.0 g x kg(-1) x d(-1), n = 447; P < 0.05). Rates of length gain did not differ among the 3 groups. A total of 8% of children in each feeding group developed edema, indicative of severe malnutrition, while receiving supplemental feeding. We conclude that FS are superior supplementary foods to CSB for moderately wasted Malawian children. 	01/04/2009	a	0	0		1	en	139	4	10.3945/JN.108.104018	journal of nutrition	773-778	2009	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://jn.nutrition.org/content/139/4/773.full'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/139/4/773/4670427'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://doi.org/10.3945%2Fjn.108.104018'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19225128'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19225128/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103027454'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19225128'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] 12 rural study sites in the southern region of Malawi	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] a small number of caretakers reported sharing the supplements with others corn is the staple food	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] 493 male participants and 869 female child participants	0	Education, Education, [info] mothers were instructed that the supplements were medicines and that were not to be given to children who were not ill or shared with other children who were sick prompted by the healthcare professionals the increased compliance and vigilance of caretakers (mostly mothers) contributed to high recovery rates	0	Social capital, Social capital, [info] children present at the study sites during recruitment period suggesting there was at least one social network or connection	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] [Time] 1362 children 6-60 months of age and had moderate wasting according to WHO guidelines of weight-for-height z-score < -2 but â‰¥-3 were included in the study children who had signs of severe malnutrition, including having a weight-for-height z-score <-3 and/or edema chronic illness cardiac disease congenital abnormalities cancer or those who had been discharged from the nutritional rehabilitation unit were not eligible for the study

To evaluate a concise program of self-care education delivered by an arthritis nurse specialist as an adjunct to primary care for inner-city patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).        Methods. An attention-controlled clinical trial; 211 inner-city patients with knee OA were assigned arbitrarily to education (E) or attention-control (AC) conditions. Group E received an individualized 30-60-minute educational intervention that emphasized non-pharmacologic management of joint pain, preservation of function by problem-solving, and practice of principles of joint protection. Brief telephone contacts 1 week and 4 weeks later monitored and reinforced new self-care activities. Group AC viewed a 20-minute standardized public education presentation on arthritis and received followup telephone calls (only to encourage continued participation in the study). Outcomes included the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability and Discomfort Scales, 10-cm visual analog scales measuring knee pain at rest and while walking, and the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale. Assessments were made at baseline and at 4-month intervals for 1 year.        Results. A total of 165 subjects (78%) completed all assessments. After control for baseline status, group E had significantly lower scores for disability and resting knee pain throughout the year of postintervention followup (P < 0.05 for both). Effects were somewhat discordant. By 12 months, functional benefits had begun to wane, while the effect on resting knee pain had grown. The overall effects of education on walking knee pain, overall joint pain (by HAQ), and general health status (by QWB) were not significant.        Conclusion. Self-care education for inner-city patients with knee OA, delivered as an adjunct to primary care, was found to result in notable preservation of function and control of resting knee pain. The magnitude of the observed effects compares well with those of more labor-intensive and time-consuming intervention models. However, more sustained preservation of function and consistent effects on pain may require prolonged, more proactive followup, either by the patient educator or by a trained clinical assistant dedicated to the task of supporting self-care by patients with knee OA. 	01/08/1997	a	0	0		1	en	40	8	10.1002/ART.1780400815	arthritis & rheumatism	1466-1474	1997	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/art.1780400815'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/art.1780400815'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9259427/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9259427'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] inner city	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However in countries where this policy is implemented poor access and low compliance have been widely reported. Novel approaches are needed to deliver this intervention. The objective was to assess whether traditional birth attendants drug-shop vendors community reproductive health workers and adolescent peer mobilizers can administer IPTp with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to pregnant women reach those at greatest risk of malaria and increase access and compliance with IPTp. An intervention study compared the delivery of IPTp in the community with routine delivery of IPTp at health units. The primary outcome measures were the proportion of adolescents and primigravidae accessed and the proportion of women who received two doses of SP. The study also assessed the effect of the intervention on access to malaria treatment antenatal care other services and related costs. More women (67.5%) received two doses of SP through the community approach compared with health units (39.9%; P less than 0.0001). Women who accessed IPTp in the community were at an earlier stage of pregnancy (21.0 weeks of gestation) than women who accessed IPTp at health units (23.1 weeks of gestation; P less than 0.0001). However health units were visited by a higher proportion of primigravidae (23.6% vs 20.0%; P less than 0.04) and adolescents (28.4% vs 25.0%; P less than 0.03). Generally women who accessed IPTp at health units made more visits for malaria treatment (2.6 (1.0-4.7) vs 1.8 (1.4-2.2); P less than 0.03). At recruitment more women who accessed IPTp at health units sought malaria treatment compared with those who accessed IPTp in the community (56.9% vs 49.2%). However at delivery a high proportion of women who accessed IPTp in the community had sought malaria treatment (70.3%) suggesting the possibility that the novel approach had a positive impact on care seeking for malaria. Similarly utilization of antenatalcare insecticide-treated nets and delivery care by women in the community was high. The total costs per woman receiving two doses of SP for IPTp were 4093 Uganda shillings (US$ 2.3) for women who accessed IPTp at health units and 4491 Uganda shillings (US$ 2.6) for women who accessed IPTp in the community. The community approach was effective for the delivery of IPTp although women still accessed and benefited from malaria treatment and other services at health units. However the costs for accessing malaria treatment and other services are high and could be a limiting factor in mitigating the burden of malaria in Uganda.

In the integrated housing program, case management and housing services were provided by teams within a single agency and were closely coordinated. In the parallel housing condition, case management services were provided by mobile assertive community treatment teams and housing by routine community-based landlords. Adults with severe mental illness who were at high risk for homelessness (n = 121; 72.7% schizophrenia spectrum) were assigned randomly to integrated or parallel housing services and followed for 18 months. Integrated housing services led to more days of stable housing and greater life satisfaction than parallel housing services, especially for male participants. Integrated housing services were also associated with greater reductions in psychiatric symptoms. Closer integration between clinical and housing services, and greater use of supervised living settings, led to more time in stable housing for participants in the integrated housing services condition and was associated with greater gains in several outcome domains. 	01/01/2004	a	0	0		1	en	30	4	10.1093/OXFORDJOURNALS.SCHBUL.A007146	schizophrenia bulletin	969-982	2004	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/4/969.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15957201'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/30/4/969/1931352'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15957201'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-03315-027'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15957201/'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] participants were recruited from community mental health centers, hospitals, homeless shelters, food kitchens, drop-in centers, crisis housing, and hotels 85.1 percent were homeless the average number of months homeless in their lifetime was 51.7 and their average age at the time of their first homeless episode was 28.9 years (SD = 10.9)	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] most of the participants were African-American (82.6%)	Occupation, Occupation, [info] unemployed (90.1%)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] over half of the final study group members were women (52.1%)	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] 72.7 percent of the study group had schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 27.3 percent had mood disorders

However, there is limited information about whether these patients are representative of the wider MS population. The objective of this study was to compare incident MS cases who were MS clinic users to non-users of the specialty MS clinics in British Columbia, Canada.        Methods    This was a retrospective record-linkage cohort study using prospectively collected data from the British Columbia Multiple Sclerosis database and province-wide health administrative databases.        Results    There were 2841 incident MS cases between 1996 and 2004 including 1648 (58%) that had registered at an MS clinic (‘clinic cases’) and 1193 (42%) that had not (‘non-clinic cases’). Gender and socioeconomic status distributions were similar; however, non-clinic cases were older, accessed health services more frequently and had a higher burden of comorbidity than clinic cases. Only 1% of the non-clinic cases had filled a prescription for an MS-specific disease-modifying therapy, compared to 51% of the clinic cases.        Conclusions    Our findings have several important implications: even within a publicly funded healthcare system, a high proportion of individuals with MS may not access a specialty MS clinic; the needs of MS patients managed in the community may differ from those referred to an MS clinic; findings from studies involving clinic-based MS cohorts may not always be generalizable to the wider MS population; and access to population-based health administrative data offers the opportunity to gain a broader understanding of MS. 	15/03/2016	a	0	0		1	en	23	6	10.1111/ENE.12990	european journal of neurology	1093-1100	2016	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC5021105'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.12990'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5021105'}, {'U': 'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.12990/full'}, {'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992124'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (annual income quintiles)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age mental health (having a mood or anxiety disorder)

Interpreter-assisted data collection included key informant interviews, focus groups and face-to-face surveys with the Somali community of Columbus, Ohio about child passenger safety. Measurements included prevalence of child safety seats use, awareness and knowledge of and barriers to proper use in order to inform development, implementation, and initial evaluation of a culturally-appropriate intervention for Somali families. Somali parents regarded child passenger safety as an important topic, but many reported improper restraint behaviors of one or more children and/or did not have an adequate number of child safety seats. Few parents reported having child safety seats installed by a professional technician. Child passenger safety practices in the Somali communities of Columbus are a public health concern that should be addressed with culturally-appropriate interventions. 	01/04/2017	a	0	0		1	en	42	2	10.1007/S10900-016-0246-Y	journal of community health	221-227	2017	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/49170/cdc_49170_DS1.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5644337'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10900-016-0246-y'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/49170'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5644337'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Columbia USA	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] Somali refugees and immigrants in USA	Occupation, Occupation, [info] key informant interviews revealed unemployment is a problem in the community	0	0	Education, Education, [info] key informant review revealed that the community has a problem of illiteracy	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] not reported but says the community has a problem of daily living	Social capital, Social capital, [info] key informant reviews mentions says the community has a problem of adjustment and culture shock	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal / Time] key informant interviews revealed that time send in refugee camps and displaced status has led to mental health issues
2049926327	using a focus group to determine car seat use among mothers of children aged 3 to 7 years	2032188133 | 2152083246 | 2119446515 | 1978921991 | 2016061265 | 2127593025 | 2134174736 | 2075921976	526869908 | 11884785 | 3017944768 | 187212893 | 71924100 | 190385971 | 166735990 | 56995899 | 137403100 | 138496976 | 2780240375	774484340 | 2566799812	PURPOSE: This study built on prior research and examined the beliefs, behaviors, barriers and motivating factors for use of child car seats with children aged 3 to 7 years. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two focus groups of eight mothers each were conducted using a structured interview guide. One group consisted of African American and Latina women, the other of White women. RESULTS: All of the mothers believed that properly restraining their children while riding in a car protected the children from injury. Most also reported that they have used car seats for their children. African American and Latina mothers, however, reported more inconsistent use of the seats, particularly with older children of this age group. They were also more likely to report greater resistance by their children to use car seats. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this small study, there were ethnic disparities in differences in use of child car seats for children aged 3 to 7; this subject requires more research. In the meantime, public health programs on child car seats are needed and should take into account differing beliefs and behaviors of various cultural groups.

Design A comparative efficacy trial study was conducted with moderately wasted children, using a controlled randomized design, with parallel assignment for RUSF or CSB+. Every child received a daily ration of 167 kJ (40 kcal)/kg body weight during 56 d with a follow-up performed every 14 d. Every caregiver received nutrition counselling at enrolment and at each follow-up visit. Setting Health districts of Mvog-Beti and Evodoula in the Centre region of Cameroon. Subjects Eight hundred and thirty-three children aged 6-59 months were screened and eighty-one malnourished children (weight-for-height Z-score between -3 and -2) aged 25-59 months were selected. Results Of children treated with CSB+ and RUSF, 73 % (95 % CI 59 %, 87 %) and 85 % (95 % CI 73 %, 97 %), respectively, recovered from moderate acute malnutrition, with no significant difference between groups. The mean duration of treatment required to achieve recovery was 44 d in the RUSF group and 51 d in the CSB+ group (log-rank test, P=0·0048). Conclusions There was no significant difference in recovery rate between the groups. Both CSB+ and RUSF were relatively successful for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition in children. Despite the relatively low ration size provided, the recovery rates observed for both groups were comparable to or higher than those reported in previous studies, a probable effect of nutrition education. 	01/02/2016	a	0	0		1	en	19	2	10.1017/S1368980015001238	public health nutrition	363-370	2016	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/82462A07E8EAE986B907EBF50EA99703/S1368980015001238a.pdf/div-class-title-recovery-rate-of-children-with-moderate-acute-malnutrition-treated-with-ready-to-use-supplementary-food-rusf-or-improved-corn-soya-blend-csb-a-randomized-controlled-trial-div.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5174958'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25939394/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/recovery-rate-of-children-with-moderate-acute-malnutrition-treated-with-readytouse-supplementary-food-rusf-or-improved-cornsoya-blend-csb-a-randomized-controlled-trial/82462A07E8EAE986B907EBF50EA99703'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25939394'}, {'U': 'http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1368980015001238'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] health districts of Mvog-Beti (urban area) or Evodoula (rural area) in the Centre region of Cameroon 	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] food sharing could not be excluded	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] 49 female child participants and 32 male child participants	0	Education, Education, [info] it was inferred that most caretakers were literate since informed written consent was provided to the researchers and no mention is made of verbal consent nutrition and general health counselling were provided to all caregivers including information about how best to use the food they had in their homes the illness of the participants and the benefit of supplementary feeding this investment in education is hypothesized to have contributed to high recovery rates despite the study providing the participants and their caretakers with lower quantities of supplements caregivers were instructed to continue to feed children their usual diet along with the supplementary food as medicine (364) the key messages included (i) continue to breast-feed your child until he is 2 years old (ii) wash your hands and your childâ€™s hands with soap and water before eating (iii) wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet or cleaning your childs bottom (iv) help your child eat and finish all food (v) feed your child a variety of foods every day (vi) vegetables are good for your child it help him keep healthy and prevent illness (vii) foods from animals help your child gain weight grow strong and lively give them every day (viii) give fruits to your child every day (ix) add beans soya or groundnuts in your childs porridge every day and (x) keep food and water covered 	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] most children were living in contexts of moderate food insecurity	Social capital, Social capital, [info] Cameroon has a national protocol for the management of acute malnutrition indicating political and health networks no report about how children were recruited so it is difficult to assess the social networks and connections of participants data was collected regarding whether the participants lived with both of their parents education level of the mother whether the mother was the primary caregiver whether the mother had a job food consumption score the sex of the child whether the child lived in a rural or urban area the type of supplementary food eating by the child and vaccination history of the child however only the type of supplementary food received was a significant predictor of recovery 	Plus, Plus, [info] [Pesronal] [Time] 81 children aged 25-59 months with moderate acute malnutrition moderate acute malnutrition is defined as weight-for-height between âˆ’3 SD and âˆ’2 SD below the median weight-for-height of the WHO child growth standards (weight-for-height z-score between -3 and -2) without oedema children were excluded from the study if they had no appetite a chronic debilitating illness and/or a history of peanut allergies

Housing typically is not provided to homeless persons during drug abuse treatment. We examined how treatment outcomes were affected under 3 different housing provision conditions.Methods. We studied 196 cocaine-dependent participants who received day treatment and no housing (NH), housing contingent on drug abstinence (ACH), or housing not contingent on abstinence (NACH). Drug use was monitored with urine testing.Results. The ACH group had a higher prevalence of drug abstinence than the NACH group (after control for treatment attendance), which in turn had a higher prevalence than the NH group. All 3 groups showed significant improvement in maintaining employment and housing.Conclusions. The results of this and previous trials indicate that providing abstinence-contingent housing to homeless substance abusers in treatment is an efficacious, effective, and practical intervention. Programs to provide such housing should be considered in policy initiatives. 	01/07/2005	a	0	0		1	en	95	7	10.2105/AJPH.2004.039743	american journal of public health	1259-1265	2005	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2004.039743'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/aph/ajpbhl/10.2105-ajph.2004.039743_3.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15983278'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.rti.org/publication/house-or-not-house-effects-providing-housing-homeless-substance-abusers-treatment'}, {'U': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2004.039743'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] lacked a fixed nighttime residence including shelters or other temporary accommodations or were at imminent risk of becoming homeless	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] most participants were African American	Occupation, Occupation, [info] longest full-time job	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] about one-quarter were female	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] cocaine dependence [Time] veteran

We examined key indicators of access to health care and found that the majority of participants had health insurance, a usual source of care, and access to specialty care. Nevertheless, 3.8% did not have health insurance which, with application of sampling weights, corresponds to approximately 7000 people with MS in the US population. Even with insurance, population-based estimates indicated that substantial numbers of people with MS have plans that pay nothing toward prescription medication, limit their access to specialists, and restrict their choice of hospitals and providers.

Methods: We used computer-assisted telephone interviews to collect data from 2,156 people with MS on demographics, disease characteristics, and use of neurologists, other specialists, and disease-modifying agents (DMAs). We used χ 2 tests and logistic regressions to compare patients of neurologists and other providers and identify predictor variables and treatment factors associated with seeing neurologists. Results: For their usual MS care, 72.2% of participants saw a neurologist. The probability of seeing a neurologist was significantly lower for people who lacked health insurance, were poor, lived in rural areas, or were African American; had been ill for more than 15 years; had difficulty walking but did not use an assistive device; or required a wheelchair/scooter or were confined to bed. People who reported one to two relapses in the preceding year and women were significantly more likely to see neurologists. Patients of neurologists were significantly more likely to take a DMA, attend an outpatient rehabilitation program, or see an occupational therapist, urologist, or physical therapist. Conclusions: People with multiple sclerosis who see neurologists are more likely than people who see other providers to receive treatment with disease-modifying agents and see rehabilitation specialists and urologists. While some people may choose other providers, economic, insurance, racial, and geographic factors appear to limit access to neurologists.

Cultivation of fruit gardens is a low-impact agroforestry technique which alters the structure and composition of forest stands and has the potential to thereby influence animal communities. This is of particular interest in the rainforests of Southeast Asia, where limited fruit availability between intermittent mast fruiting events results in low mammal densities. We assessed how agroforestry practises of an indigenous community affect terrestrial mammal abundance, diversity and assemblage composition within Krau Wildlife Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia. We used baited camera traps to compare mammal abundance and diversity between seven fruit gardens and eight control sites. Fruit gardens contained similar species richness and abundance levels but higher diversity and almost threefold higher mammal biomass. Fruit gardens contained five times as many fruit-producing trees and a positive correlation was found between the number of fruit trees and total mammal biomass. Mammal community composition differed between the two habitats, with fruit gardens attracting nine species of conservation concern. These results suggest that traditional agroforestry systems may provide additional resources for mammals and therefore their net effects should be considered in conservation policy. 	01/02/2016	a	0	0		1	en	194		10.1016/J.BIOCON.2015.12.015	biological conservation	132-138	2016	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/31962/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/978546'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5631444'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715301968'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715301968'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Study participants were seen in an MS clinic in which a physician referral was required prior to receipt of OT services. The symptoms and functional impairments of 40 individuals with MS who were either seen or not seen for OT services were compared. Findings show that individuals with MS who were referred to OT reported more difficulties with speaking or swallowing, hand tremors, uncontrolled urinary urgency, weakness of the legs, and performing functional activities than individuals with MS who did not receive OT services. Results also suggest that difficulties in functional mobility, work, community mobility and meal preparation were more likely to prompt OT referral and subsequent therapy for individuals who had attended the MS Clinic than any specific sign or symptom. 	01/01/2004	a	0	0		1	en	17	3	10.1080/J003V17N03_03	occupational therapy in health care	27-43	2004	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://augusta.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/analysis-of-symptoms-functional-impairments-and-participation-in--2'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23941220'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23941220'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/J003v17n03_03'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] place (urban rural)	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (Caucasian African American)	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (years of education)	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (upper middle lower)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (severity of MS symptoms) mental health (depression symptoms)

Interventions to increase PA could improve outcomes. METHODS We tested the efficacy of a novel Internet-mediated, pedometer-based exercise intervention. Veterans with COPD (N = 239) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the (1) intervention group (Omron HJ-720 ITC pedometer and Internet-mediated program) or (2) wait-list control group (pedometer). The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQL), assessed by the St. George s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), at 4 months. We examined the SGRQ total score (SGRQ-TS) and three domain scores: Symptoms, Activities, and Impact. The secondary outcome was daily step counts. Linear regression models assessed the effect of intervention on outcomes. RESULTS Participants had a mean age of 67 ± 9 years, and 94% were men. There was no significant between-group difference in mean 4-month SGRQ-TS (2.3 units, P = .14). Nevertheless, a significantly greater proportion of intervention participants than control subjects had at least a 4-unit improvement in SGRQ-TS, the minimum clinically important difference (53% vs 39%, respectively, P = .05). For domain scores, the intervention group had a lower (reflecting better HRQL) mean than the control group by 4.6 units for Symptoms ( P = .046) and by 3.3 units for Impact ( P = .049). There was no significant difference in Activities score between the two groups. Compared with the control subjects, intervention participants walked 779 more steps per day at 4 months ( P = .005). CONCLUSIONS An Internet-mediated, pedometer-based walking program can improve domains of HRQL and daily step counts at 4 months in people with COPD.

However the uptake of VCT varies according to service delivery model and is influenced by a number of factors. The aim of this study therefore, was to compare predictors for uptake of facility and home based VCT in a rural context. A longitudinal study with cross-sectional investigative phases was conducted at two sites (Rugando and Kabingo) in southwestern Uganda between November 2007 (baseline) and March 2008 (follow up). During the baseline visit, facility based VCT was offered at the main health centre in Rugando while home based VCT was offered at the household level in Kabingo and a mixed survey questionnaire administered to the respondents. The results presented in this paper are derived from only the baseline data. Nine hundred ninety four (994) respondents were interviewed, of whom 500 received facility based VCT in Rugando and 494 home based VCT in Kabingo during the baseline visit. The respondents had a mean age of 32.2 years (SD 10.9) and were mainly female (68 percent). Clients who received facility based VCT were less likely to be residents of the more rural households (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 0.14, 95% CI 0.07, 0.22). The clients who received home based VCT were less likely to report having an STI symptom (aOR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.46, 0.86), and more likely to be worried about discrimination if they contracted AIDS (aOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.22, 2.61). The uptake of VCT provided through either the facility or home based models is influenced by client characteristics such as proximity to service delivery points, HIV related symptoms, and fear of discrimination in rural Uganda. Interventions that seek to improve uptake of VCT should provide potential clients with both facility and home based VCT options within a given setting. The clients are then able to select a model for VCT that best fits their characteristics. This is likely to have positive implications for both service coverage and uptake by different sub-groups within particular communities. 	04/03/2011	a	0	0		1	en	11	1	10.1186/1472-6963-11-54	bmc health services research	54-54	2011	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1472-6963-11-54.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3060861'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3060861/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-11-54'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1472-6963-11-54'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/56908730/facility-and-home-based-hiv-counseling-and-testing-a-comparative-analysis-of-uptake-of'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ place of residence +	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender â€“	0	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education +	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation â€“ SES -	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Relationships] utilisation â€“ marital status -

The program has not achieved optimal functioning, particularly in relation to raising levels of contraceptive use. One reason may be that the LHWs face the same mobility constraints that necessitated their appointment. Past research has documented the influence of gendered norms and extended family (biradari) relationships on rural women s mobility patterns. This study explores whether and how these socio-cultural factors also impact LHWs  home-visit rates. A mixed-method study was conducted across 21 villages in one district of Punjab in 2009-2010. Social mapping exercises with 21 LHWs were used to identify and survey 803 women of reproductive age. The survey data and maps were linked to visually delineate the LHWs  visitation patterns. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 LHWs and 27 community members. Members of a LHW s biradari had two times higher odds of reporting a visit by their LHW and were twice as likely to be satisfied with their supply of contraceptives. Qualitative data showed that LHWs mobility led to a loss of status of women performing this role. Movement into space occupied by unrelated males was particularly shameful. Caste-based village hierarchies further discouraged visits beyond biradari boundaries. In response to these normative proscriptions, LHWs adopted strategies to reduce the amount of home visiting undertaken and to avoid visits to non-biradari homes. The findings suggest that LHW performance is constrained by both gender and biradari/caste-based hierarchies. Further, since LHWs tended to be poor and low caste, and at the same time preferentially visited co-members of their extended family who are likely to share similar socioeconomic circumstances, the program may be differentially providing health care services to poorer households, albeit through an unintended route. 	01/08/2013	a	0	0		1	en	91		10.1016/J.SOCSCIMED.2013.05.007	social science & medicine	48-57	2013	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23849238'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/9951'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.05.007'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:socmed:v:91:y:2013:i:c:p:48-57'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/23849238'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v91y2013icp48-57.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23849238/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613002815'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613002815'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] access â€“ SES +	Social capital, Social capital, [info] access â€“ social capital - quality â€“ social capital -	0

We investigated the acceptability of home-based delivery of counselling and HIV testing in urban and rural populations in Zambia where VCT has been offered mostly from local clinics. Methods: A population-based HIV survey was conducted in selected communities in 2003 (n = 5035). All participants stating willingness to be HIV tested were offered VCT at home and all counselling was conducted in the participants  homes. In the urban area post-test counselling and giving of results were done the following day whereas in rural areas this could take 1-3 weeks. Results: Of those who indicated willingness to be HIV tested, 76.1% (95%CI 74.9-77.2) were counselled and received the test result. Overall, there was an increase in the proportion ever HIV tested from 18% before provision of homebased VCT to 38% after. The highest increase was in rural areas; among young rural men aged 15-24 years up from 14% to 42% vs. for urban men from 17% to 37%. Test rates by educational attainment changed from being positively associated to be evenly distributed after home-based VCT. Conclusions: A high uptake was achieved by delivering HIV counselling and testing at home. The highest uptakes were seen in rural areas, in young people and groups with low educational attainment, resulting in substantial reductions in existing inequalities in accessing VCT services. 	17/06/2010	a	0	0		1	en	10	1	10.1186/1471-2458-10-347	bmc public health	347-347	2010	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1471-2458-10-347.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2902437/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20553631'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-10-347'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/30896545'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://doaj.org/article/596f5ea294b54c98bf03f6b58aeac31c'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-10-347'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/57375595/home-based-voluntary-hiv-counselling-and-testing-found-highly-acceptable-and-to-reduce'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20553631/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/10/347/abstract'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103197529'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.k4health.org/sites/default/files/home-based%20vct.pdf'}, {'U': 'http://bora.uib.no/bitstream/1956/4679/1/Home-based%20voluntary%20HIV%20counselling.pdf'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-10-347/tables/2'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ place of residence +	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender +	0	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education +	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] access â€“ age +

NaFeEDTA is the only iron (Fe) compound suitable for fortifying high extraction flours. We tested the hypothesis that NaFeEDTA-fortified, whole wheat flour reduces Fe deficiency (ID) and improves body Fe stores (BIS) and cognitive performance in Indian children. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled, school feeding trial, 6- to 15-y-old, Fe-depleted children (n = 401) were randomly assigned to either a daily wheat-based lunch meal fortified with 6 mg of Fe as NaFeEDTA or an otherwise identical unfortified control meal. Hemoglobin (Hb) and Fe status were measured at baseline, 3.5 mo, and 7 mo. Cognitive performance was evaluated at baseline and 7 mo in children (n = 170) at one of the study sites. After 7 mo, the prevalence of ID and ID anemia in the treatment group significantly decreased from 62 to 21% and 18 to 9%, respectively. There was a time x treatment interaction for Hb, serum ferritin, transferrin receptor, zinc protoporphyrin, and BIS (all P < 0.0001). Changes in BIS differed between the groups; it increased in the treatment group (0.04 ± 0.04 mmol/kg body weight) and decreased in the control group (-0.02 ± 0.04 mmol/kg body weight) (P < 0.0001). In sensory tests, NaFeEDTA-fortified flour could not be differentiated from unfortified flour. There were no significant differences in cognitive performance tests between the groups. NaFeEDTA-fortified wheat flour markedly improved BIS and reduced ID in Fe-depleted children. It may be recommended for wider use in national school feeding programs. 	01/11/2012	a	0	0		1	en	142	11	10.3945/JN.111.155135	journal of nutrition	1997-2003	2012	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://jn.nutrition.org/content/142/11/1997.full.pdf+html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/142/11/1997/4743383'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23014487/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23014487'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] urban primary school in Bangalore city Karnataka state India and 2 rural primary schools in Vadu Maharashtra state India	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] children attending these schools were taught in Kannada and Marathi the local languages spoken in Bangalore and Vadu respectively	Occupation, Occupation, [info] school children	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] both	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] poor communities	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] children of 6-13 years in Bangalore and 7-15 years in Vadu

With the newly introduced World Health Organization growth standards, more children at an early stage of malnutrition will be treated following the dietary protocols as for severe acute malnutrition, including ready-to-use thera- peutic food (RUTF). We compared the effectiveness of RUTF and a corn/soy-blend (CSB)-based pre-mix for the treatment of MAM in the supplementary feeding programmes (SFPs) supported by Medecins Sans Frontieres, located in the Zinder region (south of Niger). Children measuring 65 to <110 cm, newly admitted with MAM (weight-for-height (WHM%) between 70% and <80% of the NCHS median) were randomly allocated to receive either RUTF (Plumpy Nut, 1000 kcal day � 1 )o r a CSB pre-mix (1231 kcal day � 1 ). Other interventions were similar in both groups (e.g. weekly family ration and ration at discharge). Children were followed weekly up to recovery (WHM% � 85% for 2 consecutive weeks). In total, 215 children were recruited in the RUTF group and 236 children in the CSB pre-mix group with an overall recovery rate of 79.1 and 64.4%, respectively (p < 0.001). There was no evidence for a difference between death, defaulter and non-responder rates. More transfers to the inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Centre (I-TFC) were observed in the CSB pre-mix group (19.1%) compared to the RUTF group (9.3%) (p ¼ 0.003). The average weight gain up to discharge was 1.08 g kg � 1 day � 1 higher in the RUTF group (95% confidence interval: 0.46-1.70) and the length of stay was 2 weeks shorter in the RUTF group (p < 0.001). For the treatment of childhood MAM in Niger, RUTF resulted in a higher weight gain, a higher recovery rate, a shorter length of stay and a lower transfer rate to the I-TFC compared to a CSB pre-mix. This might have important implications on the efficacy and the quality of SFPs. 	01/12/2010	a	0	0		1	en	56	6	10.1093/TROPEJ/FMQ019	journal of tropical pediatrics	407-413	2010	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://fieldresearch.msf.org/msf/handle/10144/188269'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://tropej.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/6/407'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.epicentre.msf.org/sites/epicentre.msf.org/files/478_Nackers%20et%20al.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332221'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/tropej/article/56/6/407/1665429'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20332221/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103366498'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/68275'}, {'U': 'https://fieldresearch.msf.org/bitstream/10144/188269/1/100323_Nackers_RUTFvsCSB-Niger_JTropPediatr-2010-56-407-13.pdf'}, {'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103366498.html'}, {'U': 'http://tropej.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/03/23/tropej.fmq019.abstract'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] the study was conducted in two supplementary feeding centres in the remote and difficult-to-access villages of Mallawa and Bangaza in the Magaria department Zinder region South of Niger the supplementary feeding programmes in the region were supported by MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res 	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] there is a hunger gap each year that usually lasts from 3 to 6 months between May and October in this region when the previous years stocks have run out but the new crop is not yet ready for harvest	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] 252 female child participants and 299 male children	0	Education, Education, [info] caretakers were provided with nutritional advice on a weekly basis	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] participants resided in an area that is affected by chronic food insecurity that is marked each year with a hunger gap period when the previous years stocks have run out but the new crop is not yet ready for harvest this period usually lasts from 3 to 6 months between May and October	Social capital, Social capital, [info] the two supplementary feeding centres in Mallawa and Bangaza were part of a larger programme with a total of 14 ambulatory therapeutic feeding centres and 2 inpatient therapeutic feeding centres indicating a social network dedicated to health 	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] [Time] 551 children 6-59 months of age and measuring 65 to < 80% (National Center for Health Statistics reference) without oedema and with a mid-upper arm circumference â‰¥ 110 mm children requiring hospitalization and those who had been hospitalized or admitted in a nutritional programme in the previous 2 months were excluded from the study

Since national testing rates are often less than optimal, there is growing interest in expanding testing coverage through the implementation of innovative models such as home-based HIV counselling and testing (HBHCT). With the aim of informing scale up, this paper discusses client characteristics and acceptability of an HBHCT intervention implemented in rural South Africa. 	25/09/2012	a	0	0		1	en	12	1	10.1186/1471-2458-12-824	bmc public health	824-824	2012	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1471-2458-12-824.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3487909'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-824'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-12-824'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/57152201/client-characteristics-and-acceptability-of-a-home-based-hiv-counselling-and-testing'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23009202/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3487909'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-12-824/fulltext.html'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender -	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] utilisation â€“ age +

This results in a significant burden on the health care system, in particular primary care, and on the workplace. Chronic pain management with cognitive-behavioral psychological treatment is effective in reducing pain intensity and interference, health-related quality of life, mood, and return to work. However, the population of individuals with chronic pain far exceeds the population of therapists that can provide this care face-to-face. The use of tailored, Web-based interventions for the management of chronic pain could address limitations to access by virtue of its unlimited scalability. Objective: To examine the effects of a tailored Web-based chronic pain management program on subjective pain, activity and work interference, quality of life and health, and stress. Methods: Eligible participants accessed the online pain management program and informed consent via participating employer or health care benefit systems; program participants who completed baseline, 1-, and 6-month assessments were included in the study. Of the 645 participants, the mean age was 56.16 years (SD 12.83), most were female (447/645, 69.3%), and white (505/641, 78.8%). Frequent pain complaints were joint (249/645, 38.6%), back (218/645, 33.8%), and osteoarthritis (174/654, 27.0%). The online pain management program used evidence-based theories of cognitive behavioral intervention, motivational enhancement, and health behavior change to address self-management, coping, medical adherence, social support, comorbidities, and productivity. The program content was individually tailored on several relevant participant variables. Results: Both pain intensity (mean 5.30, SD 2.46), and unpleasantness (mean 5.43, SD 2.52) decreased significantly from baseline to 1-month (mean 4.16, SD 2.69 and mean 4.24, 2.81, respectively) and 6-month (mean 3.78, SD 2.79 and mean 3.78, SD 2.79, respectively) assessments ( P <.001). The magnitude of the 6-month effects were large. Trends for decreases in pain interference (36.8% reported moderate or enormous interference) reached significance at 6 months (28.9%, P <.001). The percentage of the sample reporting fair or poor quality of life decreased significantly from 20.6% at baseline to 16.5% at 6 months ( P =.006). Conclusions: Results suggest that the tailored online chronic pain management program showed promising effects on pain at 1 and 6 months posttreatment and quality of life at 6 months posttreatment in this naturalistic study. Further research is warranted to determine the significance and magnitude of the intervention’s effects in a randomized controlled trial.

However the sustainability of these strategies remains weak in low- and middle-income countries. In food-secure settings an educational/behavioral intervention could be an alternative for improving MAM management. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effectiveness of weekly context-appropriate child-centered counseling (CCC) with an improved corn-soy blend [corn-soy blend with added micronutrients (CSB++)] or a locally produced ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) in treating MAM through first-line rural health services. DESIGN: We used a cluster randomized controlled trial design with 3 arms involving 18 rural health centers (6 by arm) and children aged 6-24 mo with uncomplicated MAM. In the first arm (CCC) trained health workers provided weekly personalized counseling to caretakers. In the 2 other arms children received weekly either 455 g CSB++ or 350 g locally produced soy-based RUSF. Both food supplements provided approximately 250 kcal/d. RESULTS: The recovery rate after 3 mo of treatment was significantly lower with CCC (57.8%) than with CSB++ (74.5%) and RUSF (74.2%) (P < 0001). Mothers attendance at health facilities was also substantially lower in the CCC arm (P < 0001); this arm had a high defaulter rate (P < 0.003). When the analysis was adjusted for attendance we did not find a significant difference between the 3 arms with incidence rate ratios of 1.14 (95% CI: 0.99 1.31) and 1.13 (95% CI: 0.98 1.30) for the CSB++ and RUSF arms respectively compared with the CCC arm. CONCLUSION: Whereas supplement-based treatment of MAM was found to be more effective than the provision of CCC we hypothesize that appropriate and specific nutrition counseling centered on childrens needs through primary health facilities might be an alternative strategy for MAM treatment in rural food-secure areas provided that attendance at counseling sessions by the caregiver is ensured.

Results show that farmers in the study region of Uganda deplete about 1.2% of the nutrient stock stored in the topsoil per year, leading to a predicted 0.2% annual reduction in crop productivity. Replacing the depleted nutrients using the cheapest inorganic fertilizers would cost about 20% of farm income on average. Land investments such as soil and water conservation structures and agroforestry trees were found to increase agricultural productivity and reduce land degradation. We observed an inverse farm size - crop productivity relationship. Larger families are more productive but use more erosive practices in crop production. Participation in agricultural extension, especially the new National Agricultural Advisory Services program, and access to credit and markets are associated with increased productivity but have insignificant impacts on land degradation. Education is associated with greater productivity, but also with more soil nutrient depletion. Access to roads is associated with less soil nutrient depletion. We find no significant differences in crop productivity associated with differences in land tenure systems, though land degradation is greater on mailo than freehold land. Our results show that promotion of agricultural modernization through technical assistance and credit programs, investments in infrastructure and education can improve agricultural productivity. However, they also show that many of these investments do not necessarily reduce land degradation, and some may contribute to it. Thus, investing in agricultural modernization should be complemented by greater efforts to address land degradation. 	01/01/2006	a	0	0		1	en						2006	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/iaae06/25781.html'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

The intervention consisted of volunteers educating mothers and providing a 3-day course of pre-packaged chloroquine plus sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine tablets (HOMAPAK), free of charge, for the treatment of under-five fevers. Using a structured questionnaire, information was obtained on care-seeking and treatment practices before ( n  = 498) and 18 months after the introduction of HBMF ( n  = 587). Assessment of the intervention effect indicated 13.5% improvement in the accumulated proportion of patients (1) treated, (2) treated within 24 h of illness onset, (3) treated with the recommended antimalarials, (4) treated at an adequate dosage and (5) treated for the correct duration. Combining this with the antimalarial drug efficacy resulted in a 10.4% improvement in the community effectiveness of malaria treatment. HOMAPAK use was reported in 25% of 156 febrile children; 23% in the most poor compared with 50% in the least poor. Using HOMAPAK instead of other allopathic antimalarials increased the likelihood of completing all steps (odds ratio 37, 95% CI 4.8–286). Similar to other large-scale public health interventions, this study demonstrates modest practice changes at the population level. However, practices improved markedly among HOMAPAK users, suggesting that intensifying implementation efforts to increase HOMAPAK use, especially among the poorest, would be beneficial. 	01/12/2007	a	0	0		1	en	101	12	10.1016/J.TRSTMH.2007.08.005	transactions of the royal society of tropical medicine and hygiene	1199-1207	2007	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article-abstract/101/12/1199/1904845'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17945320'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/home-based-management-of-fever-and-malaria-treatment-practices-in'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17945320'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035920307002465'}, {'U': 'http://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article-abstract/101/12/1199/1904845'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035920307002465'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender +	0	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education +	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation â€“ SES -	0	0

The sample consisted of 858 impoverished African-American and Latina women (S = 448, T = 410). At baseline, women in the traditional group reported significantly higher distress, greater knowledge of AIDS, and less problem-focused coping. Significant improvements over the 2-week intervention interval were found for participants of both AIDS education programs for appraisal of threat, concerns, knowledge, and attitudes about AIDS, emotion-focused coping, number of sexual partners, IV and non-IV drug use, depression, and distress. However, multivariate analysis indicated that the traditional group had slightly better posttest scores on concerns, emotionfocused coping, knowledge of AIDS, and number of partners than the specialized group. The specialized group reported greater use of problem-focused coping. These differences do not detract from the substantial improvement found for both groups, but they do reinforce the conclusion that the specialized program was not more effective than its standard counterpart. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 	01/02/1993	a	0	0		1	en	16	1	10.1002/NUR.4770160104	research in nursing & health	Nov-21	1993	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nur.4770160104'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-30723-001'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8488308'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] homeless woman was defined as one who spent the previous night in a shelter hotel motel or home of a relative or friend and was uncertain as to her residence in the next 60 days or stated that she did not have a home or house of her own in which to reside	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] eligible candidates had to be African-American or Latina women	Occupation, Occupation, [info] women were predominantly single African-American and unemployed	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] women	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] recent history of drug addiction HIV positive

Research participants in this quasi-experimental study included 241 homeless women, who were randomly assigned by residence (drug treatment program or shelter) to one of four treatment groups. The outcomes measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months were risk behaviors, cognitive factors, and psychological functioning. Study results demonstrated significant improvements at both 6 and 12 months for the entire sample in all psychological, behavioral and cognitive outcome variables except active coping. Women in the specialized program improved more on AIDS knowledge and reduction in non-injection drug use than did those in the traditional program, but their active coping scores declined. Participation of a supportive person did not appear to have any effect on outcome. 	01/10/1998	a	0	0		1	en	10	5		aids education and prevention	433-446	1998	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/9799939'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9799939'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] resided in one of 11 homeless shelters and 9 residential drug recovery programs	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] all but two of the women were African-American or Latina	Occupation, Occupation, [info] the vast majority of women were unemployed and had children	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] women and their sexual partners 	Religion, Religion, [info] protestant (75%)	Education, Education, [info] years of education ranged from 3 to 17 years	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] drug user a prostitute [Relationships] a sexual partner of a drug user [Time] homeless and housed in a shelter

Participants were randomized by shelter to a peer-mentored, a nurse case-managed, or a standard care HIV risk-reduction program. Significant improvements were observed in all groups in all behavioral factors and cognitive and psychological resources except for self-esteem. Participants in the peer-mentored and nurse case-managed groups did not differ significantly from the standard group in self-esteem, life satisfaction, psychological well-being, use of noninjection drugs, sex with multiple partners, and unprotected sex at 6 months (n = 633). It was concluded that a standard approach by health care professionals appears to effectively modify HIV risk behaviors for a majority of homeless participants and may have important economic and policy implications. Further, the impact of short-term programs that address psychological vulnerabilities of impoverished populations needs to be studied further. 	01/10/2001	a	0	0		1	en	24	5	10.1002/NUR.1041	research in nursing & health	410-422	2001	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nur.1041'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11746070'}, {'U': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacquelyn_Flaskerud2/publication/11611012_Evaluating_the_impact_of_peer_nurse_case-managed_and_standard_HIV_risk-reduction_programs_on_psychosocial_and_health-promoting_behavioral_outcomes_among_homeless_women/links/5527f7a40cf29b22c9b9d0a4.pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] homeless defined as one who spent the previous night in a shelter hotel motel or home of a relative or friend and was uncertain as to her residence in the next 60 days or who stated that she did not have a home or house of her own in which to reside	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] African American Hispanic/Latina Anglo American other	Occupation, Occupation, [info] unemployment	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] the vast majority of the intimate partners were male (94%) however 7% of the partners were female	0	Education, Education, [info] years of education	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] lifetime history of substance abuse HIV positive

A previous study showed that ‘generic’ text reminders did not improve reattendance. Aim To assess if a personalised text message with increased contact information would increase reattendance rates of at-risk patients. Methods Patients who are at risk of future STIs, defined by having a current acute STI, attending for emergency contraception, commercial sex workers (CSWs) or men who have sex with men (MSM), were sent a text reminder to reattend for retesting 6 weeks after initial visit. Reattendance rates were measured for September to December 2012 (control group who received a generic text message) and February to May 2014 (intervention ‘personalised message’ group who received a text message containing their first name and ways to contact the clinic). Reattendance was counted within 4 months of the end of the initial episode of care. Results The reattendance rate was significantly higher for the intervention group: 149/266 (56%) than the control group: 90/273 (33%) (p=0.0001) and was also significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group in patients with the following risks: recent chlamydia (64/123 (52%) vs 43/121 (36%)) (p=0.03), recent gonorrhoea (41/64 (64%) vs 4/21 (19%)) (p=0.0003) and MSM (26/45 (58%) vs 3/18 (16%)) (p=0.006). New STI rates in the reattending intervention group and controls were 26/ 149 (17%) and 13/90 (14%) (n.s), respectively. Conclusions Sending a personalised text message with increased contact information as a reminder for retesting increased reattendance rates by 23% in patients who are at higher risk of STIs. 	01/08/2016	a	0	0		1	en	92	5	10.1136/SEXTRANS-2015-052216	sexually transmitted infections	393-395	2016	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://sti.bmj.com/content/sextrans/92/5/393.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26670912'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26670912'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://sti.bmj.com/content/92/5/393'}, {'U': 'https://sti.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2015-052216'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age [Personal] [Relationships] sexual orientation

As a consequence, several software platforms have been developed to facilitate the tracking of diabetes data to improve diabetes management. Our aim was to determine the real-world glycemic benefits of a mobile diabetes management platform used by individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Methods:Mobile platform-using (n = 899) and control (n = 900) participants meeting specific minimum data criteria were randomly selected from a database of diabetes users. All results were modeled using different mixed effect generalized linear models, assigning random intercepts for each user, and adjusting the distribution assumption for each outcome.Results:Users of the mobile platform increased their frequency of blood glucose monitoring (+8.8 tests per month, 95% CI [3.4, 14.1], P < .001) and had fewer hyperglycemic events and lower average glucose levels compared to the control group.

However, to date, little has been done to quantitatively examine the effect of crop diversity on cocoa farming efficiency. This study therefore sets out to first investigate whether and to what extent crop diversity (defined as the mixing of cocoa with other crop species on farmers  plots) affects productivity on cocoa farms. Secondly, it sought to establish whether there are economies of scope (i.e., cost complementarities) from the sharing of farm inputs by crops on the same plots. Our results indicate that diversified (i.e., multi-crop) cocoa farms are more efficient than single (i.e., mono) crop farms. Furthermore, our estimate for the economies of scope parameter indicates possibilities for cost complementarities between production of cocoa and other crops on the same plot. We advocate further investigation on the issue of scope economies to determine which crop combinations offer better cost complementarities and also meet biodiversity conservation objectives. 	15/06/2011	a	0	0		1	en	70	8	10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2011.03.013	ecological economics	1508-1518	2011	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/15115956'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ecolec:v:70:y:2011:i:8:p:1508-1518'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:240946'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolec/v70y2011i8p1508-1518.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/863107'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911001029'}, {'U': 'http://www.ruta.org/CDOC-Deployment/documentos/Scope_economies_and_technical.pdf'}, {'U': 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911001029'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	0	0	0

In order to increase farm productivity, researchers have devised alley farming, a low-input farming system which sustains crop and livestock production, can reduce competition from weeds, and conserves soil by reducing soil physico-chemical degradation and the decline of soil organic matter. The mobilization of women to adopt agricultural innovations is an important topic in development studies. Due to the important role of Nigerian women farmers in crop and livestock production, they are encouraged to adopt alley farming. Contrary to some of the literature, which claims that women are slow innovation adopters, this study argues that women farmers easily adopt innovations that can enhance their economic status. The paper argues that the characteristics of alley farming influence women farmers‘ adoption or rejection of the farming system. It was observed that the land tenure system is not an inflexible constraint on alley farming adoption. It is argued that low participation of women in agricultural innovation adoption is caused by lack of information about the advantages of the innovations, because meetings are fixed at times when women are not able to attend. This paper points out that the adoption of alley farming has increased the agricultural production and the quality of life of women farmer adopters. 	01/03/2004	a	0	0		1	en	19	1	10.1079/RAFS200366	renewable agriculture and food systems	57-65	2004	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/renewable-agriculture-and-food-systems/article/technology-adoption-behavior-of-women-farmers-the-case-of-alley-farming-in-nigeria/DDDB0618EFDC0DB63E46384587DDF49D'}, {'U': 'http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=685560'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	0

Socioeconomic status (SES) influenced the valuation of benefits. Also, the poorest households consumed more of the cheaper drug and less of the more expensive drug (P < 0.05). The least poor households mostly paid in full, whereas the poorest households paid mostly through installments (P < 0.05). The use of CHWs improved overall geographic but not socioeconomic equity to the drugs. Hence, interventions for timely and appropriate treatment of malaria should be accompanied by drug delivery and payment strategies that would ensure SES equity in consumption of appropriate malaria treatment services. 	01/07/2007	a	0	0		1	en	77	1	10.4269/AJTMH.2007.77.16	american journal of tropical medicine and hygiene	16-21	2007	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/43939556/inequities-in-valuation-of-benefits-choice-of-drugs-and-mode-of-payment-for-malaria'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/9428'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17620625'}, {'U': 'https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Obinna_Onwujekwe/publication/6216711_Inequities_in_valuation_of_benefits_choice_of_drugs_and_mode_of_payment_for_malaria_treatment_services_provided_by_community_health_workers_in_Nigeria/links/55bd3f8508ae9289a09848e1.pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] access â€“ number household residents -	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] access â€“ SES â€“ utilisation â€“ SES - quality â€“ SES -	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] access â€“ age -

Between 2002 and 2005, MS sufferers were identified, were offered DMTs only if deemed suitable by their physicians, and were monitored thereafter to assess long-term outcomes. It has been demonstrated for other therapies that judgements about suitability to receive treatment are conditioned by the patient’s deprivation status. We hypothesised that this would have been the case for DMTs also. Using individual patient data for samples in Nottingham and in Glasgow, we matched patients’ postcodes of residence with deprivation scores and confirmed that patients from more deprived areas were less likely to have been prescribed DMTs. A more detailed analysis of the Nottingham data revealed two channels through which this outcome was effected. First, people from less-deprived areas were more likely to possess clinical characteristics, such as less severe disease severity and shorter duration of the disease, that enhanced their suitability for treatment. Second, the analysis of the clinical notes detailing patients’ correspondence with the medical teams suggested that less-deprived people were more able to exercise a voice capable of influencing physicians’ prescribing decisions. 	01/04/2013	a	0	0		1	en	14	2	10.1007/S10198-012-0378-7	european journal of health economics	315-321	2013	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:eujhec:v:14:y:2013:i:2:p:315-321'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/eujhec/v14y2013i2p315-321.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10198-012-0378-7'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10198-012-0378-7'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22270579'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10198-012-0378-7.pdf'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (Index of Multiple Deprivation)	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (MS Severity scale)

Objective To compare the use of 3 education systems that varied media (face-to-face vs. electronic), communication (e.g. synchronous and asynchronous) and information processing functionality (e.g. Internet searching, view laboratory blood test results) for education of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Design/Methods In a randomized controlled trial, changes in glycated hemoglobin (A1C), self-efficacy and diabetes knowledge were compared between 3 models of education and communication support in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes: controls (face-to-face education, synchronous and asynchronous communication), Web Static (electronic education and virtual appointments using asynchronous communication) and Web Interactive (electronic education and virtual appointments using both synchronous and asynchronous communication). Results In an intent-to-treat analysis, all 3 groups had similar improvement in diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy and diabetes self-care activities. Independent of which group subjects were randomized to, findings were significant when examining correlation between website usage and outcomes: a higher total use was associated with a higher diabetes knowledge score (r=0.265, p=0.029), a higher total diabetes self-efficacy by final study visit (r=0.317, p=0.008) and a lower A1C by final study visit (r=−0.271, p=0.026) by the last visit. Conclusions Initial diabetes education can be delivered successfully through electronic media. Higher adoption of electronic media is associated with improved clinical outcomes. 	01/10/2012	a	0	0		1	en	36	5	10.1016/J.JCJD.2012.08.006	canadian journal of diabetes	257-262	2012	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/62839/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1499267112006806'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	0

Since gains achieved by the intervention may be lost after it ends, even apparently successful interventions may not result in long-term conservation benefits, a problem known as that of permanence. This paper uses a unique dataset to examine the permanence of land use change induced by a short-term PES program implemented in Quindio, Colombia, between 2003 and 2008. This the first PES program to have a control group for comparison. Under this program, PES had been found to have a positive and highly significant impact on land use. To assess the long-term permanence of these changes, both PES recipients and control households were re-surveyed in 2011, four years after the last payment was made. We find that the land use changes that had been induced by PES were broadly sustained in intervening years, with minor differences across specific practices and sub-groups of participants. The patterns of change in the period after the PES program was completed also help better understand the reasons for the programs success. These results suggest that, at least in the case of productive land uses such as silvopastoral practices, PES programs can be effective at encouraging land owners to adopt environmentally-beneficial management practices and that the benefits will persist after payments cease. 	01/03/2016	a	0	0		1	en	11	3	10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0147829	plos one	Jan-26	2016	[{'Ty': 999, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/149937821'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/11/25/000456286_20141125112725/Rendered/PDF/927690NWP0PES000Box385375B00PUBLIC0.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4773100'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147829'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/09/20427847/evaluation-permanence-land-use-change-induced-payments-environmental-services-quind%C3%ADo-colombia'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147829'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0147829.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21039'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PLoSO..1147829P/abstract'}, {'U': 'https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/10986/21039/1/927690NWP0PES000Box385375B00PUBLIC0.pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

Soil and water conservation measures generated 25 thousand cubic m water storage capacity, reduced number of dry wells to 2 % from 86 %, increased average available water column depth in wells from 0.88 m to 4.36 m and enhanced water availability to round-the-year from four to five months during the study period. Runoff per unit area and soil loss from treated watershed was 46 and 42.2 % lower than the untreated watershed respectively in 2009. The average productivity of major crops and cropping intensity increased by 26 and 119.5% respectively in 2009–10 as compared to 2005–06. The fodder availability increased by 208 % and within four years, watershed became a fodder secure area with fodder surplus of 1.992 tonne/year/animal as compared to (-) 0.569 tonne/year/animal in 2005–06. The increased direct and indirect employment opportunities in watershed reduced migration to 9% in 2009–10 from 29% in 2007–08. 	01/01/2012	a	0	0		1	en	82	3		indian journal of agricultural sciences		2012	[{'Ty': 999, 'U': 'http://epubs.icar.org.in/ejournal/index.php/IJAgS/article/view/15947'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	0	0	0

Here, we describe here a comprehensive equity assessment carried out by the Hopital Albert Schweitzer-Haiti (HAS) in 2003. HAS has been operating health and development programs in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti for 50 years. We reviewed all available information arising from a comprehensive evaluation of the programs of HAS carried out in 1999 and 2000. As part of this evaluation, two demographic and health surveys were carried out. We carried out exit interviews with clients receiving primary health care, observations within health facilities, interviews with households related to quality of care, and focus group discussions with community-based health workers. A special study was carried out in 2003 to assess factors determining the use of prenatal care services. Finally, selected findings were obtained from the HAS information system. We found markedly reduced access to health services in the peripheral mountainous areas compared to the central plains. The quality of services was more deficient and the coverage of key services was lower in the mountains. Finally, health status, as measured by under-five mortality rates and levels of childhood malnutrition, was also worse in the mountains. These findings indicate that local health programs need to give attention to monitoring the health status as well as the quality and coverage of basic services among marginalized groups within the program service area. Health inequities will not be overcome until such monitoring occurs and leaders of health programs ensure that inequities identified are addressed in the local programming of activities. It is quite likely that, within relatively small geographic areas in resource-poor settings around the world, similar, if not even greater, levels of health inequities exist. These inequities need to be measured and addressed in order for health programs to achieve equity and maximum improvement in health status within the population. 	01/08/2007	a	0	0		1	en	6	1	10.1186/1475-9276-6-7	international journal for equity in health	07-Jul	2007	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1475-9276-6-7.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/6/1/7'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/81793083'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://doaj.org/article/d1d48fb42d6148488fc17fac1a4cb0c1'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-9276-6-7'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17678540'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/health-equity-issues-at-the-local-level-socio-geography-access-an-4'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-9276-6-7'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/health-equity-issues-at-the-local-level-socio-geography-access-an'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1971052/'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-9276-6-7/fulltext.html'}, {'U': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1475-9276-6-7?site=equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] access â€“ place of residence -	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The purpose of the analyses described in the present paper was to ascertain the variables independently associated with attendance at meetings for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), and amongst those who did attend, variables related to the level of perceived helpfulness. A postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 471 people with MS in eight randomly selected health authorities/boards across England and Scotland with the general aim of eliciting their preferences for and views of health and social care. There were 318 respondents to this questionnaire (68%), 136 (43%) of whom had attended such a meeting. Logistic regression and proportional odds regression models were used to investigate the relationships with the two outcomes of attendance and helpfulness for 23 explanatory variables drawn from the questionnaire. The explanatory variables related to the following six broad areas: socio-demographic, illness-related, support, self-management, psycho-social factors and social function. Just under half of the respondents reported that they had attended a meeting. Half of these individuals found the last meeting that they had attended to be reasonably helpful, and one in five found it of no help. The individuals who were more likely to have attended were aged 45-64 years, had been in contact with a health professional in the past 12 months and felt that they had the ability and means to access MS-related information. The last meeting was considered more helpful by those who reported greater contentment with access to MS-related information and by those with mild depression. These findings should be useful to health professionals who may consider recommending meetings to people with MS, and also to those who are engaged in ensuring that meetings are both attractive and relevant to all potential attendees. 	01/01/2003	a	0	0		1	en	11	1	10.1046/J.1365-2524.2003.00404.X	health & social care in the community	19-26	2003	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/14629229'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2524.2003.00404.x'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/variables-associated-with-attendance-at-and-the-perceived-helpful'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/variables-associated-with-attendance-at-and-the-perceived-helpfulness-of-meetings-for-people-with-multiple-sclerosis(66431c54-b1d3-4592-80c3-ae0f6cf58d58)/export.html'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14629229'}]		0	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] occupation (employment status)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (SF-36 Physical function scale) MS subtype [Relationships] social support (marital status)

It further examines the role that different dissemination approaches play in conditioning which segments of society gain access to information to the technologies and then uses them. The study made use of many different qualitative and quantitative data collection methods and samples from both pilot areas where researchers maintained a significant presence and nonpilot areas where farmers learned of the technologies through other channels. Adoption processes were analyzed quantitatively using almost 2,000 households while changes in impact indicators were measured for just over 100 households. Qualitative methods included case studies for 40 households, where researchers lived in the villages for six months, and focus group discussions involving 16 different groups. The findings showed that poverty is rampant among households and appeared to worsen during the study period. The poor were reached by many different information providers and liked certain aspects of almost all types of organizations, from government extension to community group-based methods. Access to information is mediated by social relationships of wealth, gender and status; nevertheless, poor farmers acquired a significant amount of knowledge about soil fertility management. Adoption rates are not outstanding but they are encouraging, with about 20% of all farmers using the technologies on a regular basis, and a sizable percentage of farmers newly testing. Unlike some agricultural technologies historically, SFR was found not to be biased toward people controlling and managing resources above a certain threshold. The study also found that the poor were using the agroforestry technologies to a much greater extent than they were fertilizer (about 33% of farmers not using any other soil fertility practice were trying the new systems). The technologies were almost always at least doubling yields of maize. Despite these promising signs, the systems were not found to be linked to improved household-level food security or poverty indicators, primarily because the size of the fields under the agroforestry systems was, on average, quite small.

However, older adults with chronic conditions may face many barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors. Health promotion and wellness services may help older adults with chronic conditions engage in healthy behaviors. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with the use of and unmet needs for heath promotion services among middle-aged and older adults with MS. Data from a cross-sectional telephone survey of individuals aging with MS in the mid-west USA were used for this study (n ¼ 1282). A multinomial regression model was used to identify variables associated with the utilization of health promotion services.

These individuals are part of the population of people aging with a disability. Aging with a disability is the process of growing older with a long-term physical or mental impairment acquired in childhood, as a young adult or in middle age. This process is different than aging into disability, which occurs when individuals acquire and experience sustained impairment and disability for the first time in old age. The life expectancy of persons with MS is increasing globally with variations in length of life related to age of onset, progression of disease, and timing of disability (Bergamaschi, Montomoli, Candeloro, Fratti, Citterio, & Cosi, 2005; Pekmezovic, Iaberbinski, Drulovic, Stojsavljevic, & Levie, 2002), gender (Ekestem & Lebhart, 2004), and presence of other diseases, accidents, and suicide (BronnumHansen, Koch-Henriksen, & Stenager, 2004). This increased life span often includes expansive periods of impairment and disability that significantly influence the life experiences of individuals and their families. Although clinical research has identified successful pharmaceutical treatment for MS symptoms and slowing of disease progression (Weiner, 2004), it is not clear if MS has post-onset or age-related syndromes found in other neurological conditions such as poliomyelitis (Perry, 2004), muscular dystrophy (Klingbeil, Baer & Wilson, 2004), or spinal cord injury (Bauman & Waters, 2004). While treating MS and discovering its etiology continues to be a pressing issue in biomedical research (Weiner, 2004), of specific interest to clinicians, program administrators, and policymakers is the issue of how to support the aging needs of individuals with degenerating forms of MS, an area with limited investigation (Stem, 2005). The lack of evidence-based knowledge in this area has resulted in limited guidance for interventions such as independent living or long-term care. Given this, the purpose of this paper is to strengthen the evidence in this area by investigating how people with MS currently support their independent living needs. More specifically, in the absence of a theory or model of long-term support use coupled with limited empirical research in this area, the aim of this study was to strengthen the knowledge base in this area by assessing current informal and formal support utilization by individuals with MS. In addition, the implications for practice, programs, and policies are discussed in relation to aging with MS. Specific research questions addressed in this study are: a) To what extent do persons with MS use informal and formal support services? and b) What personal and disability related characteristics are most associated with individual utilization of support services? Relevant Literature Support service use Support utilization in the area if MS consists primarily of informal support such as family care giving and formal community support such as nursing homes. In the area of informal support, challenges associated with family caregiving in the lives of persons with MS have gained attention. Specifically, a review if MS caregiver literature over the period of 1990-2002 detailed adverse consequences related to caregiving, predominately caregiver spouses, including reduced physical and mental health, decreased economic well-being, and limitations in social engagement and social support (McKeown, Porter-Armstrong & Baxter, 2003). While community supports to assist in caregiving have been identified (Cruise & Lee, 2005; Donohoe, Wineman & O Brien, 1996; Frankel, 1984; McLaughlin, 1998), most MS caregiving is informal with limited use of community services (McKeown, Porter-Armstrong & Baxter, 2003; O Hara, de Souza & Ide, 2004). … 	01/10/2007	a	0	0		1	en	73	4		journal of rehabilitation	3	2007	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-173463298/multiple-sclerosis-aging-and-support-service-utilization'}]		0	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] occupation (employment status)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (level)	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] SES (household income)	Social capital, Social capital, [info] social support (living arrangements)	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (severity MS status) mental health (self-reported)

In Bangladesh substantial inequities exist both in the use of facility-based basic obstetric care and for home births attended by skilled birth attendant. BRAC initiated an intervention on Improving Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Survival (IMNCS) in the rural areas of Bangladesh in 2008. One of the objectives of the intervention is to improve the utilization of maternal and child health care services among the poor. This study aimed to look at the impact of the intervention on utilization and also on equity of access to maternal health services. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-post comparison study was conducted in rural areas of five districts comprising three intervention (Gaibandha, Rangpur and Mymensingh) and two comparison districts (Netrokona and Naogaon). Data on health seeking behaviour for maternal health were collected from a repeated cross sectional household survey conducted in 2008 and 2010. Results: Results show that the intervention appears to cause an increase in the utilization of antenatal care. The concentration index (CI) shows that this has become pro-poor over time (from CI: 0.30 to CI: 0.04) in the intervention areas. In contrast the use of ANC from medically trained providers has become pro-rich (from, CI: 0.18 to CI: 0.22). There was a significant increase in the utilisation of trained attendants for home delivery in the intervention areas compared to the comparison areas and the change was found to be pro-poor. Use of postnatal care cervices was also found to be pro-poor (from CI: 0.37 to CI: 0.14). Utilization of ANC services provided by medically trained provider did not improve in the intervention area. However, where the intervention had a positive effect on utilization it also seemed to have had a positive effect on equity. 	02/04/2013	a	0	0		1	en	12	1	10.1186/1475-9276-12-22	international journal for equity in health	22-22	2013	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/740969.pdf'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1475-9276-12-22.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/2866'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3620556'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/can-community-level-interventions-have-an-impact-on-equity-and-ut'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/81709255'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/740969'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-9276-12-22'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1475-9276-12-22'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23547900'}, {'U': 'http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/2866/1/IJHE_from_BRAC_work_inequaity_in_utilisation.pdf'}, {'U': 'https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/23163'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] utilisation â€“ SES + (non CHW +/-)	0	0

A double-blind cluster (bari) randomised controlled trial was conducted in a rural community in Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of consumption of chapatti made of micronutrient-fortified wheat flour for 6 months by school-aged children on their vitamin A, haemoglobin and iron status. A total of 43 baris (group of households) were randomly selected. The baris were randomly assigned to either intervention or control group. The intervention group received wheat flour fortified with added micronutrients (including 66 mg hydrogen-reduced elemental iron and 3030 μg retinol equivalent as retinyl palmitate per kilogram of flour), while the control group received wheat flour without added micronutrients. A total of 352 children were enrolled in the trial, 203 in the intervention group and 149 in the control group. Analyses were carried out on children who completed the study (191 in the intervention group and 143 in the control group). Micronutrient-fortified wheat flour chapatti significantly increased serum retinol concentration at 6 months by 0.12 μmol L(-1) [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.19; P < 0.01]. The odds of vitamin A deficiency was significantly lower for children in the intervention group at 3 months [odds ratio (OR) = 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07, 0.89; P < 0.05] and 6 months (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.68; P < 0.01). No demonstrable effect of fortified chapatti consumption on iron status, haemoglobin levels or anaemia was observed. Consumption of fortified chapattis demonstrated a significant improvement in the vitamin A status, but not in iron, haemoglobin or anaemia status. 	01/12/2015	a	0	0		1	en	11		10.1111/MCN.12065	maternal and child nutrition	120-131	2015	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mcn.12065'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/double-blind-cluster-randomised-controlled-trial-of-wheat-flour-c-6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800099'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mcn.12065'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] rural areas in the Mirsarai sub-district in the south-eastern Bangladesh	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] school going children aged 6 years and above	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] both genders in	Religion, Religion, [info] culture and religion was not specified, except for the residence in a unit called Bari	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] no disability and age above 6 years

Participants were randomly assigned to contingent (CS; N = 23), where they had to meet web camera-verified SMBG goals to earn incentives, or non-contingent (NS) groups (N = 18), where they earned incentives independent of adherence. Brief motivational interviewing (MI) was given prior to the intervention. Attrition was 15 % in the CS group. Participants and parents endorsed the intervention on all intervention dimensions. Daily SMBG increased after one MI session, and further increased when incentives were added, but significantly more for so for older participants. SMBG declined slowly over time, but only returned to baseline levels for younger NS participants. Internet-based incentive interventions are feasible, acceptable, and show promise for improving adherence with SMBG. 	01/06/2016	a	0	0		1	en	6	2	10.1007/S13142-016-0397-5	translational behavioral medicine	179-188	2016	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13142-016-0410-z.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/tbm/article-abstract/6/2/179/4563183'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4927454'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13142-016-0397-5'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/76244949/erratum-to-internet-based-incentives-increase-blood-glucose-testing-with-a-non-adherent'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27198235/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927458/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.rti.org/publication/internet-based-incentives-increase-blood-glucose-testing-non-adherent-diverse-sample'}, {'U': 'https://www.rti.org/publication/erratum-internet-based-incentives-increase-blood-glucose-testing-non-adherent-diverse'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13142-016-0397-5'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus

Methods—Three focus groups conducted by a professional marketing firm.     Results—Many parents were confused about the appropriate weight and age of children who should be in booster seats; most parents incorrectly identified the age at which it was safe to use a lap-shoulder belt. Legislation was viewed as a positive factor in encouraging use. Cost of seats was frequently cited as a barrier to ownership, as were child resistance, peer pressure from older children, the need to accommodate other children in the vehicle, and the belief that a lap belt was adequate. Messages from health care providers, emergency medical services, or law enforcement personnel were believed to be most effective.     Conclusion—Campaigns to promote booster seat use should address issues of knowledge about appropriate age and size of the child, cost, inadequacy of lap belts, and resistance to use by the child. 	01/09/2001	a	0	0		1	en	7	3	10.1136/IP.7.3.210	injury prevention	210-213	2001	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/injuryprev/7/3/210.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1730742'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/7/3/210'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=693873'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11565986'}, {'U': 'https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/ip.7.3.210'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Seattle USA	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] only English speaking were included	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] all but three were women	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] conducted in three different socioeconomic areas of the Seattle metropolitan area for diversity	0	0

The purpose of this investigation is to determine the extent to which these variables; namely MS severity, employment status, and gender; influence perceived difficulties in completing daily living tasks and confidence in ability to maintain an independent living situation into the future. Severity of Multiple Sclerosis Severity of MS is closely associated with an individual s ability to function in home and community and to maintain employment and secure financial resources needed to live independently (Beatty, Blanco, Wilbanks, Paul, & Hames, 1995). Researchers have estimated severity of MS using a variety of variables such as number of symptoms (Rumrill, Roessler, & Fitzgerald, 2004), extent of cognitive impairment (Beatty et al.), and perceived symptom severity (Aronson, 1997). In her qualitative research, O Day (1998) reported that unemployed adults with MS who wanted to work considered severity of their condition, particularly in terms of cognitive impairment, to be their greatest personal barrier. Similarly, Verdier-Taillefer et al. (1995) found that 99% of adults with MS in their study who were unemployed attributed their unemployment to the severity of their MS. Although closely related, MS severity and employment status are obviously two different constructs. Hence, it is important to consider both in relation to problems with daily living tasks and level of confidence in ability to maintain housing suitable for independent living. Employment Status Employment status (i.e., whether individuals are employed or unemployed) is another important variable influencing the independence of women and men with MS. Certainly, whether or not an individual is employed and, therefore, has the financial resources to maintain an accessible, adapted home environment represents another important consideration pertaining to the impact of chronic illness. As Smith et al. (2005) pointed out, financial security increases in significance during stressful times.  Wealth could help protect against negative life events, either by enabling the purchase of goods and services or by buffering well-being against the effects of these events  (p.663). In general, evidence indicates that women with disabilities have the lowest employment rate and highest poverty level of any socio-demographic group resulting, in part, from disability and gender-based discrimination (Parish, Rose, & Andrews, 2009). However, in comparisons between women and men with MS the evidence is mixed regarding the comparability of employment rates. Several studies have shown that women with MS are more likely to be unemployed and to leave their employment prematurely (Ketelaer, 1993; LaRocca et al., 1985; McFadden et al., 2012) while other studies have reported either no differences in the employment rates of women and men with MS (Edgley, Sullivan, & Dehoux, 1991; Phillips & Stuifbergen, 2006) or higher rates of employment among women with MS than men with MS (Khan, Turner-Stokes, Ng, & Kilpatrick, 2007). Consequently, although it is difficult to know what to expect when investigating employment trends among women and men with MS, differences by gender could influence adaptation to MS, particularly in terms of capability to perform daily living tasks and access resources needed to secure and maintain adapted housing (Smith, Longa, Kabeto, & Ubel, 2005). In one recent study, 60% of the women indicated that inability to meet home and work demands was the most important reason they left their employment (McFadden et al.). Gender Gender is a critical variable in any study of MS and life outcomes because multiple sclerosis is one of several autoimmune diseases which occur more frequently in women than men (McCarthy, 2000). … 	01/10/2013	a	0	0		1	en	79	4		journal of rehabilitation	33	2013	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-352037740/severity-employment-and-gender-factors-influencing'}]		0	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] occupation (employment status)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] disability (severity)

Adapted from an empirically informed intervention to prevent recurrent homelessness among individuals, the Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) supports mothers with children for a 9-month period as they move from homeless shelters into affordable housing. The case management team uses a structured intervention to encourage mothers to create and maintain necessary connections in the community for key family supports. Method: We use a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 210) to test whether homeless mothers referred to FCTI experience greater declines in psychopathology compared with those receiving homeless services-as-usual. All families receive access to affordable housing. Hierarchical linear models examine changes in symptomatology at shelter entry and 3, 9, and 15 months later.

A survey was performed to determine the impact of cultural and socioeconomic factors on the quality of care for low-income minorities with multiple sclerosis (MS) enrolled in Independence Care System (ICS), a Medicaid long-term managed care plan. All 92 ICS members with a diagnosis of MS were surveyed on three aspects of their care: specialty contact, immunomodulating drug therapy and osteoporosis prevention. Of those surveyed, 32% were never seen by an MS specialist. One third were not taking immunomodulatory medications, primarily due to noncompliance caused by a lack of understanding about these drugs. The prevention of osteoporosis and potential fracture in this high-risk population was largely neglected by providers despite the fact that the majority of those surveyed also reported balance difficulties and a history of falling. The survey revealed several deficiencies in the care of low-income minorities with MS. A major issue was the lack of adequate education, particularly about the immunomodulating drugs. Education about the importance of osteoporosis prevention, falls mitigation programmes and rehabilitation evaluations are critical interventions to decrease the risk of fracture. 	01/12/2005	a	0	0		1	en	11	6	10.1191/1352458505MS1215OA	multiple sclerosis journal	635-640	2005	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'http://monkeyman.pbworks.com/f/MS+management+for+low-income+minorities+-+journal.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://msj.sagepub.com/content/11/6/635.full.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/1352458505ms1215oa'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16320721/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16320721'}, {'U': 'http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/1352458505ms1215oa'}, {'U': 'https://msj.sagepub.com/content/11/6/635.abstract'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	0	0	0

Design Randomised controlled trial among HIV infected patients initiating antiretroviral treatment.  Setting Three diverse healthcare delivery settings in south India: two ambulatory clinics within the Indian national programme and one private HIV healthcare clinic.  Participants 631 HIV infected, ART naive, adult patients eligible to initiate first line ART were randomly assigned to mobile phone intervention (n=315) or standard care (n=316) and followed for 96 weeks..  Intervention The intervention consisted of customised, interactive, automated voice reminders, and a pictorial message that were sent weekly to the patients’ mobile phones for the duration of the study.  Main outcome measures The primary outcome was time to virological failure (viral load >400 copies/mL on two consecutive measurements). Secondary outcomes included ART adherence measured by pill count, death rate, and attrition rate. Suboptimal adherence was defined as mean adherence <95%.  Results Using an intention-to-treat approach we found no observed difference in time to virological failure between the allocation groups: failures in the intervention and standard care arms were 49/315 (15.6%) and 49/316 (15.5%) respectively (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.47, P=0.95). The rate of virological failure in the intervention and standard care groups were 10.52 and 10.73 per 100 person years respectively. Comparison of suboptimal adherence was similar between both groups (unadjusted incidence rate ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.65, P=0.14). Incidence proportion of patients with suboptimal adherence was 81/300 (27.0%) in the intervention arm and 65/299 (21.7%) in the standard care arm. The results of analyses adjusted for potential confounders were similar, indicating no significant difference between the allocation groups. Other secondary outcomes such as death and attrition rates, and subgroup analysis also showed comparable results across allocation groups.  Conclusions In this multicentre randomised controlled trial among ART naive patients initiating first line ART within the Indian national programme, we found no significant effect of the mobile phone intervention on either time to virological failure or ART adherence at the end of two years of therapy.

While community case management of malaria is effective for increasing coverage, evidence is mixed on whether it improves equity. The objective of this study was to assess whether a community case management of a malaria programme delivered by community health workers (CHW) in two districts of Kenya improved access and equity. Methods Data on child fever treatment practices, malaria prevention and CHW visits was collected through cross-sectional household surveys in project communities before (December 2008) and after 1 year of intervention (December 2009). Indicators were analysed by household wealth rank (grouped into poorest [bottom 20%], poor [middle 60%] and least poor [top 20%]) and survey. Results Data were available from 763 households at baseline and 856 households at endline. At endline, access to prompt and effective malaria treatment was higher compared with baseline for all groups, with the highest proportions among the poorest (67.6%) and the poor (63.2%), and the lowest proportion among the least poor (43.4%). Corresponding data suggest this was linked to the household s interaction with a CHW as the source of advice/treatment for child fever. Conclusion These findings provide evidence that in a resource-poor setting, CHWs can provide lifesaving interventions to the poorest. 	01/09/2013	a	0	0		1	en	5	3	10.1093/INTHEALTH/IHT017	international health	196-204	2013	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/66261'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24030270'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/5/3/196/652074'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24030270/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24030270'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] access â€“ SES + utilisation â€“ SES + empowerment â€“ SES +	0	0

The strategy is reported to increase contraceptive knowledge and use. Although CBD agents have the advantage of reaching the poor in rural areas, wealth gap does exist even in these settings. The objective of this study was to determine access to information and modern contraceptives services among people of different wealth status in a rural setting in Muheza, Tanzania. This cross-sectional study was conducted following a six year project in promotion of contraceptive using community-based agents. The study area was stratified into three socio-geographical strata from which one village was randomly selected. Through house-to-house visits, interviews were conducted using structured questionnaires until the required sample size was obtained. A community-led wealth ranking criteria was developed through consensus and used to classify respondents into wealth categories. A total of 1,420 respondents were interviewed. Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) for modern methods was 32.2%; injectables accounted for half (50.8%) followed by pills (32.7%). CBD agents accounted for one-third (34.3%) of the contraceptive use. There was no difference in the access to information (P=0.44) and to contraceptives (P=0.83) between the poorer and the less poor. Half of the respondents (49.4%; 214/431) reported paying for services, with no difference between the less poor and the poorer (P=0.75). Respondents receiving services from health facilities were more likely to pay for services (61.3%) compared to CBD agents (25.0%). However, the level of satisfaction was high (approximately 70%) in both health facilities and CBD agents. This study has shown that people in the rural settings of Muheza district were able to access information and contraceptives from CBD agents and health facilities, regardless of their wealth status. There is however, need to address the issue of informal payments lest it deters people in need from accessing the services. 	01/01/2011	a	0	0		1	en	13	1	10.4314/THRB.V13I1.56350	tanzania journal of health research	01-Jul	2011	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/63393/1/th11001.pdf'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.ajol.info/index.php/thrb/article/download/56350/53523'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24409640/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/63393'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ajol.info/index.php/thrb/article/view/56350'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113334639'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24409640'}, {'U': 'https://www.ajol.info/index.php/thrb/article/viewFile/56350/53523'}, {'U': 'https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20113334639.html'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ place of residence +	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] quality â€“ SES +	0	0

Pediatricians and other advocates have been called on to encourage booster seat use in these children. The objective of this study was to identify barriers to booster seat use and strategies to increase their use. METHODS: A qualitative study consisting of focus groups and follow-up in-depth discussions were conducted among parents and/or children to elicit barriers and strategies to appropriate/best practice child restraint system use. Phase I focus groups (parents and children) identified barriers to booster seat use along with children s self-reported likes and dislikes about booster seats. Phase II focus groups (parents only) identified additional barriers to booster seat use and suggestions for strategies to increase the use of booster seats. In-depth telephone discussions (parents only) were conducted after each phase of focus groups to identify new themes and to explore further previously emerged topics that were not conducive to probing in focus group settings. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that although knowledge of the benefits and purpose of booster seats is an important issue in promoting booster seat use, it is not the only issue. In particular, differences in risk perception, awareness/knowledge, and parenting style were noted when comparing parents of children in booster seats with those whose children were in seat belts. Media campaigns, improved laws, parenting education, and extending the use of child restraints to older ages were among the strategies suggested by parents to increase booster seat use. CONCLUSIONS: Anticipatory guidance regarding booster seats may be new for many pediatricians. This article arms pediatricians with insights from parents about their perceptions regarding booster seats and how parents think that the booster seat message can be most effectively delivered. Furthermore, it gives insight into how parents make safety decisions for their children and the important role of children in this decision-making process. 	01/10/2002	a	0	0		1	en	110	4	10.1542/PEDS.110.4.729	pediatrics	729-736	2002	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/110/4/729'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12359786/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12359786'}, {'U': 'http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.110.4.729'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] New Jersey/ Pennsylvania USA	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] predominantly white (77% and 83% respectively in each phase)	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] female (71% and 69% in each phase)	0	Education, Education, [info] some college education (81% and 78% in each phase) 	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] ages 35â€“44 (phase I 52%) and 25â€“34 years (phase II 56%)

The data collection for the study of diversification of smallholding rubber agroforestry system (SRAS) included 300 rubber farms of 21 systems in the south, east, and northeast of Thailand. The project results revealed that there are a multitude of 21 rubber farming systems in Thailand. These systems can be classified into three main types: (1) the intercropping rubber-food crop system, growing short-lived plants, for example, pineapple, chili, banana, rice, sweet potato, long bean and corn, for a rubber period, no longer than 36 months; (2) the rubber-fruit crop system, growing multicrop within the rubber area during the rubber productive period. The most common fruit crops that have been grown in Thailand are guava, gnetum, long kong, salacca, mangosteen, durian, and levistona, etc., and (3) the rubber-timber species system, normally yielding higher income to rubber smallholders since the sales of both rubber and wood products are at the same time and this is coupled with the presently high value of wood. The important timber varieties in the rubber area are neem and teak. As for profitability of Smallholding Rubber Agro forestry System (SRAS), it was noted that pineapple, chili, salacca, and gnetum are highly profitable. However, in the rubber-pineapple system which yields the highest income, the cost of investment is the highest too, when compared to the rubber-gnetum system which requires minimal input and low cost of production and management. The main conditions for decision-making in the rubber intercropping system are as follows: (1) farm household labor requirement, (2) knowledge and experience, (3) extension and policy implication, (4) marketing opportunity, (5) consistent capability of local communities, and (6) land topography and sustainability. For SRAS development strategy in the southern Thailand, improvement should be made on pricing and marketing of agroforestry products, appropriate technology for higher productivity, greater farm efficiency and risk reduction at farm level, and more synchronized co-ordination among stakeholder agencies at the regional level. 	01/01/2011	a	0	0		1	en						2011	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://kasetsartjournal.ku.ac.th/kuj_files/2011/A1110061054121083.pdf'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] tropical	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

The plantations were located in the villages of Gudha, Kohand, Nain and Sutana. The plantations varied with respect to the plantation management, the tree species and the use of intercrops. The economic performance is evaluated by calculating the net present values (NPVs) of the four (agro-) forestry systems. The NPVs are compared to the NPVs of the reference land use, i.e., the land use before the establishment of the (agro-) forestry plantations. The impact of soil regeneration via (agro-) forestry plantations on the NPVs is evaluated as well. Also the costs of production (COP) of three biomass applications (fuelwood, timber and charcoal) are calculated and compared to market prices to estimate the economic competitiveness of these commodities. The results show that the NPV ranges from −196 to 1197 €/ha without subsidies and 318 to 1441 €/ha with subsidies. In most cases the NPVs of subsidized plantations are well above the NPVs of the reference land use. However, without subsidies only the NPV of the (agro-) forestry plantation in Gudha is higher than that of the reference land use. The highest NPV is observed in Gudha, which is due to the high economic value of the tree species Acacia nilotica and Eucalyptus teriticornis and the fodder crop Leptochloa fusca. In Nain and Sutana Prosopis juliflora trees were planted at a higher density compared to Gudha and Kohand, which resulted in a higher productivity, but also higher establishment and maintenance costs. The net result is a NPV lower than at Gudha. Furthermore, the study found that (agro-) forestry plantations can help regenerate alkaline soils for conventional rice and wheat production. Soil regeneration can increase the NPV strongly but the actual increase depends on the method used to quantify the value of soil regeneration. The results also indicate that the production of fuelwood and charcoal from wood from (agro-) forestry plantations on alkaline soils is competitive with existing production chains. For timber the results are mixed. The results of this study show the need and benefits of optimizing the economic performance of (agro-) forestry plantations as part of current and future policies by, for example, subsidizing (parts of the) establishment costs and creating a mechanism by which soil regeneration is rewarded. 	01/12/2011	a	0	0		1	en	15	4	10.1016/J.ESD.2011.08.002	energy for sustainable development	388-397	2011	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/224874'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/39750116'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/887908'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F224874'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973082611000640'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] temperate	0	0	0	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	0

The consequences of MS-related incapacity on the socioeconomic factors studied were considerable. Almost half (45%) of prevalent MS cases aged 18-64 years were fully sick listed and only one-third (35%) were not sick listed at all. Every fourth individual in the prevalence population received professional assistance, and 9% were living in care homes or special apartments for the disabled. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) as the strongest predictor of sick leave. The time from symptom onset to full sick leave leading to temporary or permanent disability pension was significantly shorter for cases with progressive onset, higher age at onset and in males. The risk of full sick leave due to MS was six times higher than in the general population. 	01/10/2003	a	0	0		1	en	9	5	10.1191/1352458503MS955OA	multiple sclerosis journal	515-520	2003	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/14582779'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/1352458503ms955oa'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14582779'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (severity measured by EDSS)

A 1-group pre- and posttest design was employed. The educational symposium was the intervention variable. Speakers were experts in the field of arthritis care. Participants were recruited from a community senior center. Participants completed the Short Form of the Arthritis Impact Management Scales (AIMS2-SF), the Summary of Arthritis Management Methods (SAMMS), and a 6-question Knowledge Test about OA before the symposium. The knowledge test was administered again at the completion of the program. Posttesting of the AIMS2-SF and SAMMS occurred 3 months later to assess changes in arthritis impact and self-management strategies. Knowledge scores increased significantly immediately following the symposium. The AIMS2-SF subscales of Affect, Symptom, and Physical Function decreased significantly 3 months after the symposiu... 	01/01/2004	a	0	0		1	en	21	4	10.1207/S15327655JCHN2104_3	journal of community health nursing	229-238	2004	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/3427829'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15537548'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327655jchn2104_3'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] African Americans	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Finding the ideal Fe fortification compound, however, remains a challenge. In the present study the effect of ferrous bisglycinate as fortificant in brown bread was compared with that of electrolytic Fe among Fe-deficient school children in a randomised controlled trial. Children (n 160), aged 6-11 years, with serum ferritin <20 microg/l, were randomly assigned to one of three treatment categories: (i) standard unfortified bread; (ii) bread with electrolytic Fe as fortificant; and (iii) bread with ferrous bisglycinate as fortificant. Each child received four slices of bread (120 g) on school days, which supplied an average of 3.66 mg elemental Fe per intervention day for 137 d (2.52 mg/d for 75 d and 5.04 mg/d for 62 d) over a period of 7.5 months. Hb, serum ferritin, serum Fe and transferrin saturation were measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Significant treatment effects were observed for Hb (P = 0.013), serum Fe (P = 0.041) and transferrin saturation (P = 0.042) in the ferrous bisglycinate group, but not in the electrolytic Fe group. There were no significant intervention effects for serum ferritin in either treatment group. Overall, ferrous bisglycinate as Fe fortificant in brown bread performed better than electrolytic Fe in a group of Fe-deficient school children over a period of 7.5 months. 	01/03/2006	a	0	0		1	en	95	3	10.1079/BJN20051669	british journal of nutrition	532-538	2006	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DF7C46BBB830C8A6E5B7C142207197F6/S0007114506000729a.pdf/div-class-title-the-efficacy-of-ferrous-bisglycinate-and-electrolytic-iron-as-fortificants-in-bread-in-iron-deficient-school-children-div.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/efficacy-of-ferrous-bisglycinate-and-electrolytic-iron-as-fortificants-in-bread-in-irondeficient-school-children/DF7C46BBB830C8A6E5B7C142207197F6'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512940'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Western Cape South Africa	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] school children	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] both	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] the school was serving those belonging to low socioeconomic community	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] children aged 6-11 with serum ferritin < 20 mg/L

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sodium iron EDTA (NaFeEDTA) and ferrous fumarate at levels compatible with South African brown bread (10 mg/kg flour for NaFeEDTA and 20 mg/kg flour for ferrous fumarate) in a randomized controlled trial; electrolytic iron was evaluated at the level currently used in South Africa (35 mg/kg flour). Schoolchildren (n = 361), aged 6-11 y, from a low socioeconomic community with hemoglobin (Hb) < or = 125 g/L were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups that received 4 slices of brown bread supplying either: 1) no fortification iron 2) 2.35 mg iron as NaFeEDTA; 3) 4.70 mg iron as ferrous fumarate; and 4) 8.30 mg iron as electrolytic iron per intervention day. These amounts simulated a bread intake of 6 slices per day over the 34-wk study period at fortification levels of 0, 10, 20, and 35 mg/kg flour, respectively. Hb concentration and iron status were assessed at baseline and after 34 wk of intervention. The iron interventions did not affect Hb concentration, transferrin saturation, or serum ferritin, iron, or transferrin receptor concentrations relative to the control group. Our results suggest that electrolytic iron at the level currently used in South Africa is not effective in improving iron or Hb status. Neither do NaFeEDTA or ferrous fumarate appear to be suitable alternatives for the fortification of wheat flour when included at levels that do not cause color changes. 	01/04/2008	a	0	0		1	en	138	4	10.1093/JN/138.4.782	journal of nutrition	782-786	2008	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://core.ac.uk/display/38219781'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://dspace.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/2989'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://jn.nutrition.org/content/138/4/782.abstract'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/138/4/782/4665055'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18356335'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://repository.nwu.ac.za:443/handle/10394/2989'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18356335'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] Western Cape South Africa	0	Occupation, Occupation, [info] school children	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] both	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] serving a low socioeconomic status community	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] children aged 6 to 11 years with haemoglobin â‰¤125 g/L

Twelve residents in Paediatrics from University of Parma, Italy, prepared in a hospital near the capital Freetown with modest technology a mixture of peanut flour, palm oil, milk powder, sugar and vitamins to which they gave the name of ”Parma pap”. Three hundred and thirty-two malnourished children (mean age 14±6.3 months) who were receiving Feeding Program Supplementations (FPS), were enrolled in the study: 177 participants received randomly FSP portions only (Group 1), and 159 participants were treated with FSP regimen plus a supplement of “Parma pap” (Group 2). Outcomes of the study were computed as WHZ-score increment (Δ value) by subtracting the discharge WHZ-score from the admission WHZ-score. The best Δ-WHZ-scores (>+4) were recorded among participants of Group 2 (64%) rather than in Group 1 (21%; p=0.040). The children receiving FSP portions plus “Parma pap” recovered faster (5.54 week on average) than those treated with FSP regimen only (8.16 on average). The percentage of children who did not recover was higher in Group 1 (25.3%) than in Group 2 (; 13%; p=0.05). A slight positive correlation has been found between WHZ-scores at admission and at the end of the study (r=0.19; p=0.045). During the experience in Sierra Leone we have had the chance to give “Parma pap” to twenty one malnourished children admitted to Xaverian Mission in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, not taking other supplementary food. Sixteen of these children recovered in 4.9 week on average and five in 6 to 8 weeks. Mean Δ-WHZ-scores ranged between + 1 and + 5. The data from the present study suggest that “Parma pap” could be an effective additional food to FPS regimen in malnutrition recovering. Further researches are needed on the contrary to prove if “Parma pap” could be defined as a veritable ready to use therapeutic food, although this characteristic seems already to result from the experience in Makeni Mission. 	17/12/2014	a	0	0		1	en	85	3			236-242	2014	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25567460'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.mattioli1885.com/onlinejournals/index.php/actabiomedica/article/view/3978'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25567460'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25567460/'}, {'U': 'https://www.mattioli1885.com/onlinejournals/index.php/actabiomedica/article/download/3978/3184'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] two study sites in Sierra Leone 1 G hospital in a poor neighbourhood on the eastern end of Freetown 2 Xaverian Mission in Makeni a northern province 	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] N/A language translators assisted the researchers in informing participant caretakers about the study in order to obtain informed consent - researchers were aware that peanuts and palm oil were the least expensive most readily available and most popular ingredients to prepare a supplementary food with this supplement was named Pharma Pap and was the subject of this study cultural beliefs did not allow researchers to suspend the food programme supplementations regimen in one group of participants	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] 155 male child participants and 181 female child participants	0	Education, Education, [info] N/A due to young age of participants and education of caretakers not mentioned however some mothers were literate as they signed informed consent forms mothers who were not literate gave verbal permission in addition mothers/caretakers of participants participated in the preparation of pap inferring that they received preparation education at least	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status, [info] N/A however, some caretakers found distances between villages and hospital G lack of public transports and the inability to entrust other children to another caretaker in the village during scheduled research visits at hospital prohibitive this lack of resources resulted in missed evaluation days for participants	Social capital, Social capital, [info] N/A however social connections or networks were mentioned for example lack of public transportations and caretakers resulted in some study participants missing visits for evaluation on some days children in Freetown were also receiving FSPs evidencing the existence of a social network the research also infers international academic social networks and connections since most of the researchers were residents of the post-graduate School of Paediatrics from the University of Parma in Italy the residents worked under the supervision and responsibility of a senior paediatrician working at the same hospital	Plus, Plus, [info] [Pesronal] [Time] 332 children 6-60 months of age in G hospital with moderate acute malnutrition participants from G hospital were all receiving United Nations World Food Programme Supplementations 21 children with moderate acute malnutrition who were 8 to 21 months of age in Makeni these children were not receiving supplements moderate acute malnutrition was defined as weight-for-height z-score of -3 to less than -2 SD children affected with an acquired chronic disease were excluded from the study

Methods: The authors sampled adults with MS having physician visits over a 2-year period from a group model health maintenance organization (HMO) in southern California, from a midwestern independent practice association (IPA) model managed care plan, and from the FFS portion of the practices of a random sample of southern California neurologists. The authors mailed surveys to subjects in mid-1996; 930 of 1,164 (80%) of those eligible responded. The authors measured sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, management of recent changes in mobility, bladder control, and fatigue, use of a disease-modifying agent, assessment of general health symptoms and issues, and unmet information needs. The authors adjusted comparisons between systems for comorbidity, disease severity, and disease type. Results: The groups differed on most sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. There were few differences in symptom management; differences that did exist tended toward more referrals or treatment for the FFS group. Access to the disease-modifying agent available at the time of the survey did not differ across systems, although patients’ perceptions of the rationale for not using the drug did vary. General health issues and symptoms were more often assessed in the FFS and IPA systems than in the HMO, but improvement was needed across all three systems of care. There were substantial unmet information needs in all groups and especially high ones in the FFS and HMO samples. Conclusions: Strategies to improve care for people with MS should be developed and evaluated, particularly in areas like symptom assessment and meeting patient information needs. Where variations in service delivery exist, longitudinal studies are also needed to evaluate the potential impact on outcomes and to evaluate reasons for variation. 	14/11/2000	a	0	0		1	en	55	9	10.1212/WNL.55.9.1341	neurology	1341-1349	2000	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/11087779'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://n.neurology.org/content/55/9/1341'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11087779/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11087779'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.55.9.1341'}, {'U': 'http://n.neurology.org/content/55/9/1341.full.pdf'}, {'U': 'https://n.neurology.org/content/55/9/1341.full.pdf'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] race (Caucasian African American Hispanic Other)	Occupation, Occupation, [info] occupation (employment status)	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	Education, Education, [info] education (level)	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] age disability (severity measured by ambulation) [Relationships] social support (marital status)

Self-management interventions are considered important in order to limit the progression of the disease. Computer-tailored interventions could be an effective tool to facilitate self-management. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness of a web-based, computer-tailored COPD self-management intervention on physical activity and smoking behavior. Participants were recruited from an online panel and through primary care practices. Those at risk for or diagnosed with COPD, between 40 and 70 years of age, proficient in Dutch, with access to the Internet, and with basic computer skills (n=1,325), were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=662) or control group (n=663). The intervention group received the web-based self-management application, while the control group received no intervention. Participants were not blinded to group assignment. After 6 months, the effect of the intervention was assessed for the primary outcomes, smoking cessation and physical activity, by self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form. RESULTS: Of the 1,325 participants, 1,071 (80.8%) completed the 6-month follow-up questionnaire. No significant treatment effect was found on either outcome. The application however, was used by only 36% of the participants in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: A possible explanation for the nonsignificant effect on the primary outcomes, smoking cessation and physical activity, could be the low exposure to the application as engagement with the program has been shown to be crucial for the effectiveness of computer-tailored interventions.

The goal of this study was to pilot test the scope, acceptability, and efficacy of an educational videotape and tailored TKR decision aid designed to reduce disparities in TKR knowledge and expectations.        Methods    African American and Caucasian male veteran volunteers ages 55–85 years with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) were recruited. During group meetings, patients viewed a video about knee OA treatments and were provided a personalized arthritis report that presented predicted patient outcomes should they decide to undergo TKR. Patients completed baseline and postintervention questionnaires that included an adapted Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) instrument to measure post-TKR expectations (0–100 scale with higher scores reflecting poorer outcomes).        Results    A total of 102 patients (54 African American, 48 Caucasian) completed the baseline survey and 64 patients attended the intervention. There were no significant differences by race between patients completing and those dropping out of the study. At baseline (n = 102), African American patients expressed lower expectations about post-TKR outcomes than did Caucasian patients for both pain (WOMAC score 41 versus 34; P = 0.18) and physical function expectations (WOMAC score 38 versus 30; P = 0.13). Among African Americans who underwent the intervention, expected pain and physical function improved to 31 (P = 0.04 versus baseline) and 30 (P = 0.09 versus baseline), respectively. Caucasian patients  expectations changed little.        Conclusion    Disparities in baseline knowledge and expectations about TKR may be improved with the combined educational video and tailored decision aid. 	15/05/2007	a	0	0		1	en	57	4	10.1002/ART.22670	arthritis & rheumatism	568-575	2007	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'http://rmkaplan.bol.ucla.edu/Robert_M._Kaplan/Blank_4_files/419-Arthritis%20Shared%20Decision.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://europepmc.org/article/MED/17471558'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.22670'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17471558/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17471558'}, {'U': 'http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22670/full'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] African American men	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare an Internet coping skills training (TEENCOPE) intervention to an Internet educational intervention (Managing Diabetes) for adolescents with T1D. Moderators of program efficacy were evaluated. METHODS The study was a multisite clinical trial (n = 320) with data collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Data were collected on the primary outcomes of physiologic (A1C) and psychosocial (quality of life) and on the secondary outcomes of behavioral (self-management) and psychosocial (stress, coping self-efficacy, social competence, family conflict) variables consistent with the conceptual framework. Data were analyzed using mixed-model analyses with an intent-to-treat approach. RESULTS There were no significant between-group treatment effects 6 months postintervention on primary outcomes. The Managing Diabetes youth showed a significant increase in social competence compared to the TEENCOPE youth. There were significant time effects for TEENCOPE (decreased stress and increased coping) and Managing Diabetes (improved diabetes quality of life). DISCUSSION Youth with T1D transitioning to adolescence may need both structured diabetes education and coping skills to improve health outcomes. There may be a higher potential to reach adolescents with Type 1 diabetes of varying race and ethnicity via Internet interventions. 	01/11/2012	a	0	0		1	en	61	6	10.1097/NNR.0B013E3182690A29	nursing research	395-404	2012	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4199510'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/an-internet-coping-skills-training-program-for-youth-with-type-1-'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623558'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	0	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	Plus, Plus

Methods: Veterans with MS (n = 1,032) were identified via computer database and surveyed by mail; 451 (43.7%) responded. Results: Twenty-two percent of the sample met criteria for current MDE. Low income, unemployment, presence of falls, younger age, absence of a marital partner, and high levels of perceived disability due to bowel functioning were independently associated with MDE. Disease subtype, disease duration, use of disease modifying therapies, and perceived disability due to mobility or bladder problems were unrelated to MDE. Current MDE was in turn associated with increased primary care visits and increased impact of disease upon activity participation. Similar correlates were associated with minor depressive episode. Conclusions: Unlike the general population, rates of depression in this predominantly male sample were similar to those found in predominantly female samples of persons with multiple sclerosis. Specific aspects of disability were differentially associated with depression, and depression was independently associated with increased service utilization and increased participation limitations. 	11/01/2005	a	0	0		1	en	64	1	10.1212/01.WNL.0000148480.31424.2A	neurology	75-80	2005	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://n.neurology.org/content/64/1/75'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15642907/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15642907'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.neurology.org/content/64/1/75.abstract'}, {'U': 'http://n.neurology.org/content/64/1/75.abstract'}, {'U': 'http://n.neurology.org/content/64/1/75'}]		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] mental health (presence of major depressive episode)

In addition to symptomatic treatment, immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant agents are used to prevent attacks and to influence the course of disease. Objective The goal of this study was to assess the drug use of MS patients in outpatient care considering gender-related and regional differences. Setting We analyzed outpatient claims data of the single largest German health insurance fund (about 9 million insurants) for the year 2010. Method Patients with MS were identified by outpatient ICD-10-GM-diagnosis code ‘G35’. All age groups were included. MS-specific drug use was analysed for those patients, considering regional and gender-related differences in specific drug prescriptions. Main outcome measure Prescription rates for symptomatic treatment, relapse treatment and disease-modifying treatment. Results 31,248 patients with a diagnosis of MS were identified (0.35 % of all insurants). Their mean age was 50.4 ± 14.1 years, 77.7 % of them were female. 37.6 % of the included patients were treated with disease-modifying drugs, 23.4 % got prescriptions for corticosteroids, drugs of choice for relapse therapy, and 63.1 % received symptomatic treatment as defined in the study. Women with MS were prescribed significantly more non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, urinary antispasmodics, antidepressants, tranquilizer and hypnotic drugs. Regional variations were also found, with highest usage of disease-modifying drugs in eastern regions of Germany. Conclusion This study gives an insight into the treatment of MS in daily practice by using the claims data of a large health insurance company. The prescription rate for disease modifying drugs was relatively low suggesting that early treatment was not routine practice. Furthermore, the results indicated that women with MS were more likely to receive treatment for psychiatric symptoms and pain. 	09/10/2013	a	0	0		1	en	35	6	10.1007/S11096-013-9857-X	international journal of clinical pharmacy	1229-1235	2013	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.socium.uni-bremen.de/lib/download.php?file=57d36bea08.pdf&filename=art_10.1007_s11096-013-9857-x.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11096-013-9857-x'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24104761/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24104761'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11096-013-9857-x'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] gender	0	0	0	0	0

This study aimed to identify interventions that promoted booster seat use among this population. METHODS: This multi-site study used focus groups to elicit contributing factors to booster seat non-use, which informed subsequent intervention development. A first phase (10 focus groups, N = 117) identified parents  perceived barriers, benefits, and threats relating to belt-positioning booster seats. These findings were used to identify existing and create new interventions. A second phase (20 focus groups, n = 171) elicited parent s reactions to these interventions and provided parents with belt-positioning booster seats and education on their use. Follow-up interviews were conducted six weeks later. RESULTS: Lack of education and fear of injury were the primary barriers to belt-positioning booster seat use. Parents were motivated by interventions that provided them with clear, concrete messaging relating to use. Parents favored the intervention that presented a real story detailing a child s severe injury that could have been prevented with appropriate restraint. At follow-up, parents credited this intervention with motivating booster seat use most often. Although parent s cited their child s lack of comfort and non-compliance as barriers to use, they were not as motivated by interventions that addressed these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Effective intervention programs can be created by identifying and addressing factors that contribute to a population s intention to use belt-positioning booster seats. In addition, successful programs must utilize messages that motivate the target population by addressing their perceived threats to booster seat non-use.

An intervention offering counselling and HIV results at home was conducted in four study villages following the 2001 serosurvey round, and followed by a qualitative evaluation exploring nature of demand and barriers to knowing HIV status. METHODS Data from annual serosurveys and counsellor records are analyzed to estimate the impact of the intervention on uptake of HIV test results. Textual data are analyzed from 21 focus group discussions among counsellors, and men and women who had received HIV test results, requested but not yet received, and never requested; and 34 in-depth interviews equally divided among those who had received test results either from counselling offices and homes. RESULTS Offering HIV results at home significantly increased uptake of results from 10 to 37% for all adults aged 15 (p<0.001), and 46% of those age 25 to 54. Previous male advantage in uptake of test results was effectively eliminated. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews highlight substantial non-monetary costs of getting HIV results from high-visibility public facilities prior to intervention. Inconvenience, fear of stigmatization, and emotional vulnerability of receiving results from public facilities were the most common explanations for the relative popularity of home-based voluntary counselling and testing (VCT). It is seen as less appropriate for youth and couples with conflicting attitudes toward testing. CONCLUSIONS Home delivery of results revealed significantly higher demand to know HIV status than stubbornly low uptake figures from the past would suggest. Integrating VCT into other services, locating testing centres in less visible surroundings, or directly confronting stigma surrounding testing may be less expensive ways to reproduce increased uptake with home VCT. 	01/03/2005	a	0	0		1	en	20	2	10.1093/HEAPOL/CZI013	health policy and planning	109-116	2005	[{'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15746219'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/20/2/109/568784'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15746219/'}, {'U': 'http://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/20/2/109/568784/Evaluation-of-a-homebased-voluntary-counselling'}]		0	0	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender +	0	0	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] utilisation â€“ age +

Methods    Participants with arthritis (n = 141) enrolled in the program between October 1999 and May 2001. All materials were in Spanish. Written pretest, 6-week posttest, and 6-month followup tests measured pain rating, self-report joint counts, function (modified Health Assessment Questionnaire [mHAQ]), self efficacy, self-care behavior, and arthritis knowledge.        Results    Mean age was 51 years, 92% were female, 84% were born in Mexico, 55% had sixth grade education or less, and 60% had no medical insurance. Of the 141 participants, 118 completed 6-month followup testing. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant improvement from pretest to 6-month followup in pain (6.0 versus 3.4); self efficacy (5.5 versus 8.4), self-care behavior (1.7 versus 4.9), arthritis knowledge (1.6 versus 4.5), and general health (2.1 versus 2.5), all at P < 0.001. Small improvement was reported in mHAQ (0.56 versus 0.50; P = 0.024).        Conclusion    The Spanish Arthritis Empowerment Program was successfully disseminated. Significant improvements in self efficacy and in arthritis symptoms were maintained at the 6-month followup. 	15/06/2004	a	0	0		1	en	51	3	10.1002/ART.20395	arthritis care and research	332-336	2004	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/art.20395'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.20395'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15188316'}, {'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15188316'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] Spanish-speaking community	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

METHODS: Eight thousand nine hundred and seventy participants from a community-based cohort were interviewed, provided blood for research HIV testing, and were offered VCT. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify socio-demographic, clinical and behavioural factors associated with VCT use. RESULTS: Although 31% (1246/3980) of men and 24% (1195/4990) of women expressed an interest in the service, only 12% of men and 7% of women subsequently completed VCT. Socio-demographic factors, such as marital status, area of residence, religion and ethnicity influenced VCT completion among males and females in different ways, while self-perceived risk of HIV, prior knowledge of VCT, and sex with a high-risk partner emerged as important predictors of VCT completion among both sexes. Among males only, those infected with HIV for 5 years or less tended to self-select for VCT compared to HIV-negatives (adjusted odds ratio = 1.43; 95% CI: 0.99-2.14). This contributed to a higher proportion of HIV-positive males knowing their status compared to HIV-positive females. CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, a disproportionate number of HIV-positive women are failing to learn their status, which has implications for equitable access to onward referral for care and treatment services. Evidence that some high-risk behaviours may prompt VCT use is encouraging, although further interventions are required to improve knowledge about HIV risk and the benefits of VCT. Targeted interventions are also needed to promote VCT uptake among married women and rural residents. 	01/03/2008	a	0	0		1	en	13	3	10.1111/J.1365-3156.2008.02005.X	tropical medicine & international health	319-327	2008	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02005.x'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/18397395'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/7781/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/13100792'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02005.x'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18397395/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18397395'}]		Place of residence, Place of residence, [info] utilisation â€“ place of residence -	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, [info] utilisation â€“ race -	0	Gender/sex, Gender/sex, [info] utilisation â€“ gender -	Religion, Religion, [info] utilisation â€“ religion -	Education, Education, [info] utilisation â€“ education -	0	0	Plus, Plus, [info] [Personal] utilisation â€“ age -

Given that patients provide most of their own diabetes care, patient self-management training is an important strategy for improving quality of care. Web-based interventions have the potential to bridge gaps in diabetes self-care and self-management. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a web-based patient self-management intervention on psychological (self-efficacy, quality of life, self-care) and clinical (blood pressure, cholesterol, glycemic control, weight) outcomes. 	14/12/2014	a	0	0		1	en	14	1	10.1186/S12911-014-0117-3	bmc medical informatics and decision making	117-117	2014	[{'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12911-014-0117-3.pdf'}, {'Ty': 3, 'U': 'https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/84212/1/12911_2014_Article_117.pdf'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4272538'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-014-0117-3'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://core.ac.uk/display/81771701'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/midm/midm14.html#YuPMLHNSBLS14'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12911-014-0117-3'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://paperity.org/p/56895189/a-web-based-intervention-to-support-self-management-of-patients-with-type-2-diabetes'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25495847/'}, {'Ty': 1, 'U': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25495847'}, {'U': 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12911-014-0117-3/fulltext.html'}, {'U': 'https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-014-0117-3'}]		0	Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Race/ethnicity/culture/language	Occupation, Occupation	Gender/sex, Gender/sex	0	Education, Education	Socioeconomic status, Socioeconomic status	0	Plus, Plus
